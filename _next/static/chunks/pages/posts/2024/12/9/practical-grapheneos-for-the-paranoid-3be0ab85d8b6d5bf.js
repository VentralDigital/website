GrapheneOS supports hardware-based attestation and it's entirely possible for Google to allow it as part of the Play Integrity API. They choose to ban using GrapheneOS. Play Integrity API has no minimum security patch level and nearly all these apps use weak software-based checks that are easily bypassed by attackers. The hardware-based checks rely on trusting every key distributed to every certified Android device, which are often leaked. Hardware-based attestation can be used for security purposes such as verifying device integrity with a pinning-based approach without the weakness of being vulnerable to leaked keys from the whole Android ecosystem since specific per-app keys in the secure element can be pinned. Play Integrity API is claimed to be based on devices complying with the Compatibility Test Suite and Compatibility Definition Document. We have irrefutable proof that the majority of certified Android devices do not comply with the CTS/CDD. Play Integrity API is based on lies. Essentially every non-Pixel device has important CTS failures not caused by CTS bugs. OEMs are cheating to obtain certification. Google claims GrapheneOS can't be permitted because we don't have a certification where they freely allow cheating and don't ban non-compliant devices. Since Play Integrity doesn't even have a minimum security patch level, it permits a device with multiple years of missing patches. Hardware attestation was required on all devices launched with Android 8 or later, but they don't enforce it to permit non-compliant devices. The reality is that the Play Integrity API permits devices from companies partnered with Google with privileged Google Play integration when they're running the stock OS. It's easy to bypass, but they'll make changes to block it being done at scale long term such as if we did it. It does not matter if these devices have years of missing security patches. It doesn't matter if the companies skipped or improperly implemented mandatory security features despite that being required by CDD compliance. Failing even very important CTS tests doesn't matter either. Google can either permit GrapheneOS in the Play Integrity API in the near future via the approach documented at ",(0,s.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide",children:"https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide"})," or we'll be taking legal action against them and their partners.

We comply with CTS and CDD except when it limits our ability to provide our users with privacy and security. Google wants to be in charge of which privacy/security features can be added. Nope. Google's behavior in the mobile space is highly anti-competitive. Google should be forbidden from including Google Mobile Services with privileged access unavailable to regular apps and services. GrapheneOS sandboxed Google Play proves that hardly anything even needs to change. Google should also be forbidden from participating in blocking using alternate hardware/firmware/software. They've abused their market position to reinforce their monopolies. They've used security as an excuse despite what they're doing having no relevance to it and REDUCING it.

They're holding back security, not protecting it. We've put a lot of effort into collaborating with Google to improve privacy and security for all Android users. Their business team has repeatedly vetoed even considering giving us partner access. They rolled back us being granted security partner access by the security team. As with how they handle giving out partner access, the Play Integrity API serves the interests of Google's business model. They have no valid excuse for not allowing GrapheneOS to pass device and strong integrity. If app developers want to ban it, they can still do it themselves. After our security partner access was revoked, we stopped most of our work on improving Android security. We continued reporting vulnerabilities upstream. However, we're going to stop reporting most vulnerabilities until GrapheneOS is no longer blocked by the Play Integrity API.

If Google wants more of that in the future, they can use hardware attestation to permit GrapheneOS for their device/strong integrity checks. Authy's response about their usage of the Play Integrity API shows their service is highly insecure and depends on having client side validation. Play Integrity is thoroughly insecure and easily bypassed, so it's unfortunate that according to Authy their security depends on it.

It's easy to do: ",(0,s.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide",children:"https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide"}),".

In order to make it easy to install sandboxed Google Play, our App Store provides mirrors of the official releases. These have through extensive testing by users either opting into the Alpha and Beta channels for those in our App Store along or Beta releases in the Play Store. Our compatibility layer teaches Play services and the Play Store how to function as regular apps via the standard Android APIs and permissions. It's not necessary to grant any permissions to either of them in order to use them and provide compatibility with near 100% of apps. Apps with mandatory or optional dependencies on Google Play are including Google Play libraries in their app. Many of these libraries such as Ads and Analytics work fine without Google Play services. These libraries could do everything sandboxed Google Play can do without it. For example, Google could include fallback code in the Firebase Cloud Messaging library to support receiving push messages through a service run by the app itself. Google could also support using Play services and Play Store as sandboxed apps. We've shown it works fine that way. It's important to understand that our approach is not granting any access to them or allowing them to do anything they couldn't do without it. Our compatibility layer demonstrates a regulator could reasonably require Google to not use capabilities unavailable to regular apps. Our approach also allows us to reimplement arbitrary portions of Google Play ourselves. For example, we reimplement the Play services location service by using the OS location service. By default, apps using Google Play location are redirected to standard GrapheneOS location. We provide emulated network location support to use apps depending on network location without it. We're in the process of implementing our own network location client with support for choosing between multiple services. It's currently being tested and polished up to ship it. Our opt-in network location that's going to be shipped soon is not tied to Google Play compatibility. It's available to any apps using the OS location API. Our default enabled redirection means that apps using Google Play location will transparently use this when it's enabled. We'll also be providing support for using Apple's location service or a GrapheneOS proxy to it as the starting point. We're also going to be providing our own location service based on our own database built from data scraped/merged from multiple sources which is entirely legal. Our own network location service will support downloading regional databases to use it entirely locally without sending location data to a service. We plan to provide the same features for the SUPL service used for A-GNSS which currently defaults to a GrapheneOS proxy to Google. We're also going to be providing our own implementation of geocoding (converting addresses to location) with a choice of providers which is currently in an experimental state. We can very easily host that ourselves too. We'll be doing the same for many other things over time. Our position is that useful features should be directly provided in the OS disconnected from Google Play compatibility. Apps using Google Play for it can be redirected to using the OS implementation instead with a toggle for it. We can also unify it with the provider toggles. For network-based location, it's completely legal for us to scrape enormous amounts of data from publicly available services not even requiring accounts to combine into our own multi-source database. It will allow us to provide non-satellite-dependent offline location detection. We have additional extensions beyond the baseline compatibility layer to support Android Auto. It's disabled by default, and Android Auto is a regular sandboxed app when installed. Users can choose to grant it extra USB access to use wired Android Auto.

GrapheneOS currently relies on satellite-based location (GNSS) with services to assist it (A-GNSS) called PSDS (database downloads) and SUPL. PSDS is a database of predicted satellite locations and topographical data to speed up satellite locking locks. We host our own cache of the data on our servers. SUPL is kind of a network location lite requesting data on a carrier's cell towers to speed up GNSS which we proxy.

We don't like that network location is based on revealing location to a service, although if it's done with individual queries without a long live connection via a VPN that's much less of an issue. That's why we want local database support, requiring having our own database. Building our own db entirely with data we gather is unrealistic.

Our plan is to scrape the data from services like the Apple location service and merge it with data from BeaconDB (",(0,s.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://beacondb.net",children:"https://beacondb.net"}),"). The way this works in general is that you scan for nearby cell towers, Wi-Fi APs and Bluetooth devices which then get submitted to a service to get the locations of those things which can then be used to figure out location based on signal strength to each of them. Doing it with cell towers alone is already decent for a rough estimate. Wi-Fi is incredible for this in cities. This is how iOS and Android manage to provide indoor location without satellite receptions. They get nearly all users to not opt-out of it. People are used to it. [...] Wi-Fi APs should not be brought with you since their location can be found through tons of devices sending that data to Apple, Google, etc. If you move, bringing the same Wi-Fi router will give data showing someone moved from your old location to the new one. If your Wi-Fi AP simply stays in one location, that's not a privacy issue. Hiding the SSID doesn't change that there are packets marked as coming from and going to the MAC address for that AP. Hidden SSIDs also reduce client privacy and enable tracking. Each hidden AP hidden network you have saved on a laptop, phone, etc. is broadcast every time they scan for Wi-Fi networks. It allows tracking client devices despite MAC randomization. Should never save any hidden SSID networks.

Changing the IMEi alone isn't enough to hide the device identity from the network. It will only hide one commonly used ID rather than making the device not uniquely identifiable. Carriers often detect device model via IMEI and multiple other ways as part of their standard operating procedure. They change how things work based on the detected capabilities but also hard-wired quirks for device models, etc. Devices send a lot of info on capabilities. It's possible to detect the devices with an IMEI not matching their capabilities/configuration or to detect that there's a device with the IMEI changing repeatedly but the other device identifiers remaining the same. You could end up drawing attention to yourself by doing it... Similarly, using a very niche hardware device to connect to the network such as a standalone hotspot device stands out. Those devices are also far less secure than simply using a Pixel with GrapheneOS. They typically don't get proper updates and lack basic security measures. If you really want to have cellular done from a separate device, a used Pixel with GrapheneOS is a good option. If you want a fresh identity for the cellular network, there isn't really much alternative to using both a fresh device and SIM. Wi-Fi has a much more private design. To summarize: 1) IMEI randomization is a poor way to improve privacy and will draw attention to yourself in practice. 2) Dedicated Hotspot devices aren't good for privacy/security. 3) Use airplane mode + Wi-Fi with our default per-connection MAC randomization for better privacy. MAC randomization alone was not enough. Wi-Fi has had major privacy improvements on common devices like iPhones and Pixels in recent years to neuter other tracking based on sequence numbers, etc. We're aware of 1 remaining issue which has is reported/accepted as a vulnerability. Also, bear in mind that carrying around a Wi-Fi access point (AP) is the opposite of private. An AP has a persistent MAC even if it's random upon creating the AP such as making a hotspot with a phone. Wi-Fi does not have MAC rotation like Bluetooth Low Energy privacy extensions. GrapheneOS uses per-connection MAC rand and per-connection DHCP as improvements over the standard Android Open Source Project. The MAC still remains the same while connected, and an AP isn't going to cycle until it's reset. Wi-Fi does not try to do what BLE privacy extensions do. To clarify, an access point means a router such as Wi-Fi hotspot from a phone. If you enable Wi-Fi hotspot, it chooses a random MAC and uses it until it's disabled. Bluetooth LE tries to provide privacy for a paired device being carried around incl. MAC rotation. Wi-Fi does not. [...] The radio has hardware IDs so it's very clear that it's the same device using a new SIM. There is not much point cycling one without also cycling the other at the same time. [...] In general, you should only use the supported devices, which means Pixel 6 and later. 8th/9th generation Pixels have a much more hardened OS via hardware memory tagging. 9th generation Pixels currently have more cellular baseband hardening but it may get backported to 8th gen. We're not at all particularly recommending using a 2nd device for cellular though. We're just pointing out that using GrapheneOS on a used Pixel 6a would be much more secure for that purpose than using the dedicated hotspot devices. The hotspot devices are generally awful. [...] We've explained it in this thread: 1) There are more hardware identifiers than IMEI, IMSI and EID. Avoiding using eSIMs doesn't avoid having more hardware identifiers than IMEI. 2) Network sees what kind of radio/device it is and how it behaves, which impacts how it functions. To expand on the 2nd point, that means if you choose a completely random IMEI instead of a random choice among IMEIs of a similar type of device, it will clearly be a device that's using a random IMEI. By clearly having a random IMEI, that stands out a lot and invites attention. There are typically other hardware identifiers for the radio than IMEI and the eSIM ID. It is similar to how many Wi-Fi adapters largely used to leak other info and had silly things like info on the type of adapter or even a serial number included in each probe request. [...] They can uniquely identify the radio so with a non-KYC device and non-KYC SIM, you're essentially using a persistent pseudonym. If you randomize the IMEI and switch SIMs there are still other IDs and a fully random IMEI isn't going to match your hardware which is obvious. [...] IMEI and IMSI are the most common but there are several other common hardware identifiers including ones specific to a physical SIM and ones specific to an eSIM. It's more complex than Wi-Fi where MAC address randomization commonly doesn't actually work due to other IDs. Look into papers on MAC randomization not actually working. There's some nice research on it. iPhones and Pixels made adjustments to Wi-Fi with the Wi-Fi vendors to address this but our community has found some remaining minor weaknesses which have been reported to get fixed. Cellular is far more of a mess than Wi-Fi where minimal probe information, probe sequence number randomization and a few other things combined with MAC randomization and higher level OS changes should be enough. Cellular is designed to identity the device so it's much different. In the past, Wi-Fi hardware, firmware and drivers were not carefully designed and implementation to avoid identifying the hardware to the network. This has been largely addressed for iPhones and Pixels, and it's trickling down to other smartphones. Laptops are more behind though. Cellular is a completely different story. It has a bunch of explicit device identifiers but also other ways it identifies itself to the network. There's also often persistent state for the radio which can do the same thing rather than it just being completely fresh each boot. There isn't comparable research into cellular privacy partly because of a mix of perceived and real regulatory and legal issues. People believe the issue is that changing the IMEI is illegal, but it's often legal. The real issue is that it leaks device identity despite that... Changing the main IMEI that's provided also doesn't mean that the original IMEI isn't available via diagnostic messages, but there are other identifiers. There's also often persistent radio state usable for tracking it regardless of the device identifiers. It's not very private. eSIM ID is a well documented identifier but there are more than those. Even aside from all the actual identifiers, there are other ways of tracking similar to how MAC randomization is not enough for Wi-Fi even if it's the only identifier, but cellular has more than 1 identifier. [...] There are more cellular radio identifiers than IMEI. People should really be aware that they are not truly preventing uniquely identifying the device through changing the IMEI. Randomizing IMEI is easily detected and clearly stands out from other devices too. Cellular network can see what kind of radio is connecting and what capabilities there are along with there usually being some persistent state for the radio rather than each boot being an entirely fresh start. There are also other IDs. It's just not designed to avoid tracking. It's not specific to smartphones or particular kinds of radios, it's cellular in general. Wi-Fi had awful privacy even with MAC randomization and often had other things like a serial number included in probe requests, etc. but there was research into it and problems got solved. Wi-Fi is still not perfect but at least on iPhones and Pixels it's a lot better than it was. We're aware of 1 minor issue with the Broadcom Wi-Fi radio on Pixels which only applies when connected to a network, not scanning. It has been reported and acknowledged as a security bug. [...] We're talking about there being other hardware identifiers or even the original IMEI still being shared based on research done by our community and others including with mobile hotspot devices. It is similar to Wi-Fi MAC rand before efforts to get rid of other leaked identifiers. You know there's an official eSIM ID (EID) for the eSIM secure element, right? That's a clearly documented non-IMEI hardware identifier. We're also talking about using a physical SIM though, not only eSIM. See ",(0,s.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10402530",children:"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10402530"}),". We're talking about more than that though. We cannot share the very minor Wi-Fi privacy issue disclosed to us because a firmware/driver patch is not available yet, but other Wi-Fi adapters often have far bigger issues and it's a good thing that the remaining privacy issues with regular Wi-Fi usage have become so minor. The standard Broadcom Wi-Fi adapters on Nexus and other devices used to have firmware from Broadcom adding a whole bunch of unnecessary info to probe requests and other Wi-Fi packets. They also used a sequential probe sequence number and other counters. until fully reset. Some Wi-Fi adapters literally sent off a serial number not just MAC, defeating MAC randomization. Essentially all would end up having a quite unique probe sequence number after being used for a while with a predictable rate of increase. These issues were solved for Pixels and should have trickled down to other Android devices now, although we haven't looked at how it currently works elsewhere. One relatively minor non-scanning issue is known and they should be working on it and fixing it in a few months. [...] '> I saw you recommended turning the phone off, that also doesn't prevent tracking. Powered off in a faraday bag, maybe.' Airplane mode and turning off the device work fine in practice if it doesn't have a special offline tracking system such as Apple's optional Find My network. Regulations essentially require both of those to work properly but are poorly enforced. Devices can make mistakes and have issues like airplane mode not being active in early boot.

You were also hardly endorsing Purism there but rather talking about it as someone interested in the topic. Purism has been heavily promoting their products with highly misleading and outright false claims for many years, and it's understandable people get misled by marketing. We have no interest at all in working with Purism or supporting their hardware. We're very interested in working with an OEM to make hardware to run GrapheneOS but there's absolutely no chance we work with them. They're anti-security and the false marketing causes serious harm. Yes, and they don't ship important firmware and microcode updates because of it. They also go out of the way to sabotage it by preventing updating important parts of the firmware from the OS, which instead has to be manually flashed with JTAG cables, etc. as if users will do it. They say update the firmware on their devices before shipping them, but then they don't get updates anymore. They essentially acknowledge that it's critical to security but then go out of the way to avoid it. This is the purpose and design of their products, not a side thing. Nearly the entire purpose of Purism products is avoiding updating the proprietary firmware from the OS. When they describe their hardware as open and freedom respecting, what they actually mean is the nearly entirely proprietary hardware/firmware works without the OS updating it. They make component choices largely based on using components which store firmware on their own flash storage and don't require the OS to load it. This is generally a bad security practice and it's no surprise that it leads to them choosing much less secure, sketchy components. [...] They not only avoid updating firmware/microcode, choose insecure components where they don't have to load it from the OS and block updating it but they even remove warnings in the Linux kernel and other software about out-of-date firmware and information on how to update it. Yes, that's what it does. The microcode/firmware is nearly entirely in the separate linux-firmware project.

They don't only have an issue with shipping the updates for it but even enabling people to obtain them and informing them about their device being insecure. They're actively covering up vulnerabilities to the point they're scrubbing it from log messages most people won't see. [...] They remove these kinds of warnings because they view it as promoting updating the firmware which is what they're against and the entire purpose of the project. They actively cover up security vulnerabilities and actively mislead people about it. It's ideological, that's all. They follow a religion based around software licensing, which tells them that closed source hardware and closed source firmware are out of scope as long as the firmware can't be updated. To them, a Wi-Fi SoC with no onboard firmware is bad. One with hard-wired firmware is good. They prefer hardware with the ability to update the firmware somehow disabled or broken, which they consider to be making it freedom respecting since the ability to update the closed source firmware is gone so they consider it to be hardware and out of scope for free software. It's standard FSF ideology. They could have taken the more logical approach considering open source hardware, firmware and software all important instead of only software. Instead, they came up with contrived justifications for why closed software is crucial but those aren't. Purism is catering to this ideology as their market niche.

You trust the developer, the platform where they downloaded the sources and F-Droid themselves compared to trusting the developer's own signed releases. Accrescent is better than that though. Accrescent publishes the developer signed releases but it has signed metadata itself so it secures the initial download/install without users having to use AppVerifier to check the key fingerprint themselves. You can still do that after installing if you want though. F-Droid greatly increases the risk of a supply chain attack. They do not review/audit the code they're packaging. They run trivial automated scans which attackers are aware of and can run themselves. It is highly unlikely to detect anything regardless. It's more attack surface. F-Droid adds the F-Droid developers along with their poorly maintained infrastructure and build environment as attack surface for all the apps you install from it. Getting one app from it is definitely not as risky as getting as much as you can from it since apps are sandboxed. F-Droid doesn't uphold basic security features and the security model for app sources. It doesn't keep up with current era security protections. They allow infrastructure and the build environment to get incredibly out-of-date.

Our GmsCompat app runs a foreground service and used to keep a connection open to Play services and Play Store. It now creates the connection on-demand when they need a foreground service. Toggling off background data usage for Play services and Play Store will now stop their background services being able to use data. That now blocks it from using mobile data when it's not running a foreground service since another foreground service isn't always using it anymore. Some users previously blocked background data usage for them and now they don't have FCM and other features working anymore. Similarly, some users never granted it Unrestricted battery usage which was required for FCM to work reliably but is now even more required than before. Apps can be set to one of 3 different battery modes: Restricted, Optimized (Default) and Unrestricted. Optimized heavily restricts the app running in the background based on how much it's used. Restricted nearly fully prevents apps running in the background on their own. Android 14 QPR2 changed this from a menu with the 3 options to a toggle for Restricted being on or off. The text next to the toggle is a button to open an inner menu with Optimized vs. Unrestricted. Users find this confusing and we're considering changing it back to how it was. Our sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer makes a notification requesting Unrestricted battery usage for Play services with a permission request dialog. The issue is that if users miss this or dismiss it, it's trickier than before to find the setting to enable it manually. We also show this as a detected issue in Settings > Apps > Sandboxed Google Play in the suggestions in shows. The issue is that some users may want the background usage heavily restricted for sandboxed Play services. We don't want to nag people who actually want it very limited. Our compatibility layer already shows a notification about this until users either grant Unrestricted battery mode for sandboxed Play services or press \"Don't show again\" to dismiss the notification permanently. It will show again if it's only dismissed without pressing that. It seems this isn't quite enough because we see a steady stream of people not granting Unrestricted battery mode and not realizing it's why their push notifications are delayed. It's valid to not grant it to it. It runs fine without it granted but it means push, etc. won't work. [...] Allow background usage toggle is not the same thing as the Unrestricted but rather Unrestricted is in the inner menu. Our compatibility layer requests it repeatedly after the initial install of Google Play unless you use \"Don't show again\". Only need to do it manually if you did.

You could also do it the other way around, but it makes more sense to try to use as much as possible without Google Play rather than treating not using it as the exceptional case. [...] Signing in into a Google account is optional, unless you want to use features depending on being signed into an account. For example, some apps use Google account authentication instead of their accounts having a username and password. The Play Store requires being signed into an account in order to install apps or use in-app purchases. [...] The Play Store provides many services used by apps including Play Asset Delivery, Play Feature Delivery, in-app purchases and license checks for paid apps. The Play Store app is also the most secure way to install and update apps from the Play Store.

Many games on the Play Store depend on having Google Play Games installed. [...] The compatibility layer has a configuration menu available at Settings > Apps > Sandboxed Google Play. By default, apps using Google Play geolocation are redirected to our own implementation on top of the standard OS geolocation service. You don\'t need to grant any permissions to Google Play or change any settings for working location in apps using Google Play geolocation due to our rerouting feature. If you want to use Google\'s network location service to provide location estimates without satellite reception, you can disable the "Reroute location requests to OS APIs" toggle and grant what it requires to provide network location. You will need to grant "Allow all the time" Location access to Google Play services along with the Nearby Devices permission for it to have all the access it needs. You need to use the "Google Location Accuracy" link from the sandboxed Google Play configuration menu to access the Google Play services menu for opting into their network location service, otherwise this is all pointless. It will send the nearby Wi-Fi and cellular networks provided via the Location and Nearby Devices permissions to their service to retrieve a location estimate.

Accrescent is in alpha and isn't yet open to any developers uploading their apps. It will have a lot more apps available in the future. It will become a full alternative to Play Store permitting closed source apps too, but you'll be able to filter to show only open source apps. Lead dev of Accrescent is a GrapheneOS user and contributor. It'll be a good place to publish apps for GrapheneOS users. AppVerifier, BeauTyXT and Transcribro are from the same person who wrote our Info app. Molly is a security-focused fork of Signal from another GrapheneOS user. AppVerifier was based on a planned GrapheneOS feature for users to verify APK files based on their key fingerprint. The feature is currently stalled since relying on the clipboard isn't ideal. For now, users can use AppVerifier from Accrescent until we ship a built-in approach. We'll be delegating distributing developer builds of apps signed by the developers to Accrescent rather than doing it in ourselves. Our App Store will be focused on our own apps and eventually hardened, rebranded builds of important third party apps widely used by our community. [...] We can't recommend using F-Droid due to extremely poor security practices throughout their client, repository design and infrastructure. The developers have an anti-security attitude and have demonstrated thoroughly untrustworthy behavior. We're going to be supporting Accrescent and helping them get what they need to reach a stable release and provide a huge number of apps with the support of the app developers. People are free to use F-Droid on GrapheneOS but we won't promote it. [...] F-Droid attempts to do repository metadata signing but both the approach they take and implementation is quite flawed. Transport security via HTTPS using WebPKI doesn't only trust their server. It also trusts every CA and sub-CA without a way to monitor abuse since unlike a browser there isn't enforced Certificate Transparency. We pin root keys and backup keys for our services in our apps but of course it's not what's relied on for verifying App Store repository metadata. [...] It does protect against an attacker who has compromised both the server for the app store and has obtained the developer's signing key. They would need to put a backdoor into a release, which they could do whether or not it's open source software and whether or not it's built by the app store. F-Droid pretends building apps offers protection against this but the reality is that they blindly build the code and there is no way to auto-detect backdoors being added. [...] The app's signing key is how the OS package manager verifies the app, but both our App Store and Accrescent also verify each downloaded APK based on the repository metadata. We were explaining that having control of the app repository and the developer's signing key isn't enough because the repository metadata is signed offline. That's why we said they'd need to actually put a backdoor into either the app's source code or the latest official build of the app. Reproducible build verification can't actually prevent this. It only prevents them putting it into the build without also putting it into the source code. It's clearly possible to put a backdoor into the source code without it being detected as shown by the multiple times it has been caught happening after the fact in widely used projects. The most well known recent example was the xz ssh backdoor, but that's not the only one, and there may be important missed cases.\""]}),", ",(0,s.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/112821386750410102",children:"https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/112821386750410102"})]})}),(0,s.jsx)(C.s,{reference:"304",children:(0,s.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, December 29.

This adds the option to set a PIN for using fingerprint unlock. You can use a strong diceware passphrase as the primary unlock method with fingerprint+PIN secondary unlock. The usual restrictions on fingerprint unlock still apply. It's a secondary unlock mechanism only usable for 48 hours after the last primary unlock. The limit on failed fingerprint unlock attempts in GrapheneOS is 5 as opposed to allowing 4 batches of 5 attempts (20 total) with 30s delays in between. The devices we support have a high quality secure element heavily throttling unlock attempts which is why a random 6 digit PIN provides secure encryption, unlike most Android devices. It's nicer to have a strong passphrase not depending on an attacker never being able to exploit the secure element. Our new 2-factor fingerprint unlock feature means you can get this benefit of a strong passphrase while still having the convenience of a PIN. Since our PIN scrambling feature works with the 2nd factor PIN, you get the combined anti-shoulder-surfing benefits of a scrambled PIN and a fingerprint. If you want to avoid entering your passphrase in public, you just need to make sure to refresh the 48 hour timer after last using it to unlock to keep fingerprint unlock available. We plan to add configuration for how many failed fingerprint unlock attempts are allowed to help with this use case. We came up with the concept for this 2-factor fingerprint unlock feature in 2015 and filed it in the public issue tracker in 2016. This was extremely difficult to implement correctly and we needed to fix multiple upstream Android bugs. The lockscreen will be more robust even if you don't use this. This is now one of the flagship features of GrapheneOS alongside hardened_malloc, hardware memory tagging, hardware-level disabling of the USB-C port, Storage Scopes, Contact Scopes, sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer, etc. It will be harder to port to new versions than our existing features. Our duress PIN/password feature is fully compatible with our 2-factor fingerprint unlock and will near instantly wipe the device as usual if you enter the duress PIN instead of the correct 2nd factor PIN for fingerprint unlock.
