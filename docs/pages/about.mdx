    <p>Previous to being a Security Researcher, Patrick worked in the Web2/SaaS space for over 10 years, writing and reviewing code, always feeling drawn towards the security aspects of technology. During these years he developed a keen sense for identifying edge cases and became well-practiced at technical writing that breaks down complex topics into intuitive explanations. He finally broke into the Web3/Blockchain space through the very first *Secureum Bootcamp* and was selected as a mentor due to his continued activity as alumni. Patrick has since worked as an independent consultant in BlockSec, reviewed various projects together with other independent researchers at *Spearbit*, and endeavored into many rabbit holes on the *Ventral Digital* blog. Drawing inspiration from *The Sovereign Individual*, Patrick advocates for the development and securing of key technologies that enhance privacy and promote decentralization.</p>
