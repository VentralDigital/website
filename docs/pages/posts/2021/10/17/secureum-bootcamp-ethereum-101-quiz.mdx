### Question 1 of 32

Which of the following EVM components is/are non-volatile across transactions?
 
<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Stack </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Memory </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Storage </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Calldata </li>
</ul>
 
<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is C.**

>A stack machine is a computer processor or a virtual machine in which the primary interaction is moving **short-lived temporary values to and from a push down stack**.

from [Stack machine - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine)

>The EVM is a simple stack-based architecture consisting of the stack, **volatile memory, non-volatile storage** with a word size of 256-bit (chosen to facilitate the Keccak256 hash scheme and elliptic-curve computations) and Calldata.

from point 59 of [Ethereum 101 - by Secureum](https://secureum.substack.com/p/ethereum-101)

>Calldata is a read-only byte-addressable space where the **data parameter of a transaction or call** is held.

### Question 2 of 32

The number of transactions in a Ethereum block depend on
 
<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Nothing. It is a constant </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Gas used by transactions </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Block gas limit </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Block difficulty </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B & C.**

> Block gas limit is set by miners and refers to the cap on the total amount of gas expended by all transactions in the block, which ensures that blocks can’t be arbitrarily large. Blocks therefore are not a fixed size in terms of the number of transactions because different transactions consume different amounts of gas.

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Most significant byte in the smallest memory address </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Most significant byte in the largest memory address </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. In Big-endian order </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. In Little-endian order </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A & C.**

> EVM uses big-endian ordering where the most significant byte of a word is stored at the smallest memory address and the least significant byte at the largest

### Question 4 of 32

Ethereum's thread model is characterised by

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Trusted miners and users </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Trusted users, untrusted miners </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Trusted miners, untrusted users </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Everyone is untrusted </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is D.**

> Given the aspirational absence of trusted intermediaries, everyone and everything is meant to be untrusted by default. Participants in this model include developers, miners/validators, infrastructure providers and users, all of whom could potentially be adversaries.

### Question 5 of 32

Ethereum smart contracts do not run into halting problems because

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. EVM is not Turing Complete </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. EVM is Turing Complete </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. EVM is Turing Complete but is bounded by gas sent in transaction </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. EVM is Turing Complete but is bounded by the stack depth </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is C.**

>Turing-complete systems face the challenge of the halting problem i.e. given an arbitrary program and its input, it is not solvable to determine whether the program will eventually stop running. So Ethereum cannot predict if a smart contract will terminate, or how long it will run. Therefore, to constrain the resources used by a smart contract, Ethereum introduces a metering mechanism called gas.

  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. `DUP` </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. `PUSH` </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B.**

> Most EVM instructions operate with the stack (stack-based architecture) and there are also stack-specific operations e.g. PUSH, POP, SWAP, DUP etc.

from point 60 of [Ethereum 101 - by Secureum](https://secureum.substack.com/p/ethereum-101)

> Storage is a 256-bit to 256-bit key-value store. [...] This is accessed with SLOAD/SSTORE instructions.

  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. `CREATE` </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. `SELFDESTRUCT` </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is C.**

> SLOAD is 2100 gas and SSTORE is 20,000 gas to set a storage slot from 0 to non-0 and 5,000 gas otherwise. CREATE is 32000 gas and SELFDESTRUCT is 5000 gas.

### Question 8 of 32

Transaction T1 attempts to write to storage values S1 and S2 of contract C. Transaction T2 attempts to read the same storage values S1 and S2. However, T1 reverts due to an exception after writing S2. 

Which or the following is/are TRUE?

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. T2 reads the value of S1 updated by T1 </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. T2 reads the value of S1 prior to T1's attempted update </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. T2 also reverts because of the dependency on T1 </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. This scenario is not possible </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B.**

> Transaction properties: Atomic: it is all or nothing i.e. cannot be divided or interrupted by other transactions

from point 32 of [Ethereum 101 - by Secureum](https://secureum.substack.com/p/ethereum-101)

> A transaction reverts for different exceptional conditions such as running out of gas, invalid instructions etc. in which case all state changes made so far are discarded and the original state of the account is restored as it was before this transaction executed.

### Question 9 of 32

The gas tracking website https://etherscan.io/gastracker says that Low gas cost is 40 gwei. This affects

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. The transaction gasPrice </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. The transaction gasLimit </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. The transaction value </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Both B & C </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A.**

> Gas price: The price a transaction originator is willing to pay in exchange for gas. The price is measured in wei per gas unit. The higher the gas price, the faster the transaction is likely to be confirmed on the blockchain. The suggested gas price depends on the demand for block space at the time of the transaction.

from point 35 of [Ethereum 101 - by Secureum](https://secureum.substack.com/p/ethereum-101)

> gasLimit: The maximum amount of gas the originator is willing to pay for this transaction value: The amount of ether (in wei) to send to the destination

### Question 10 of 32

Security of Ethereum DApps depend on

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Security of their smart contracts </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Security of their off-chain components </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Security of Ethereum </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A, B, C.**

> On-chain vs Off-chain: Smart contracts are “on-chain” Web3 components and they interact with “off-chain” components that are very similar to Web2 software. So the major differences in security perspectives between Web3 and Web2 mostly narrow down to security considerations of smart contracts vis-a-vis Web2 software.

  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Gas used by the transaction is credited to the beneficiary address in block header </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Unused gas is credited to the beneficiary address in block header </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Both A & B </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B.**

> Gas refund and beneficiary: Any unused gas in a transaction (gasLimit minus gas used by the transaction) is refunded to the sender’s account at the same gasPrice. Ether used to purchase gas used for the transaction is credited to the beneficiary address (specified in the block header), the address of an account typically under the control of the miner. This is the transaction “fees” paid to the miner.

  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Take operands on stack </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B, D.**

> The code in Ethereum contracts is written in a low-level, stack-based bytecode language, referred to as "Ethereum virtual machine code" or "EVM code". The code consists of a series of bytes (hence called bytecode), where each byte represents an operation.

### Question 30 of 32

Gas for EVM opcodes

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Is constant and the same for all opcodes </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. May be changed over time to prevent DoS attacks </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Depend on the gas price </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Depend on the miners </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B.**

> Gas costs for different instructions are different depending on their computational/storage load on the client

from points 78 of [Ethereum 101 - by Secureum](https://secureum.substack.com/p/ethereum-101)

> Tangerine Whistle — A hard fork to change the gas calculation for certain I/O-heavy operations and to clear the accumulated state from a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that exploited the low gas cost of those operations.
Spurious Dragon — A hard fork to address more DoS attack vectors, and another state clearing. Also, a replay attack protection mechanism.

### Question 31 of 32

Ethereum Virtual Machine is a

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Register-based virtual machine </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Stack-based virtual machine </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Heap-based virtual machine </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Stackless virtual machine </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B.**

> The EVM is a simple stack-based architecture consisting of the stack, volatile memory, non-volatile storage with a word size of 256-bit (chosen to facilitate the Keccak256 hash scheme and elliptic-curve computations) and Calldata.

  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. EVM can get the account balance only of the current account </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. EVM can get the code hash of only the current account </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B, C, D.**

> 0x31 BALANCE 1 1 Get balance of the given account    
> 0x3f EXTCODEHASH 1 1 Get hash of an account’s code    
> 0x40 BLOCKHASH 1 1 Get the hash of one of the 256 most recent complete blocks    
> 0x43 NUMBER 0 1 Get the block’s number
