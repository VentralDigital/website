### Code

<Callout type="info">
All 8 questions in this RACE are based on the `InSecureumApe` contract. This is the same contract you will see for all the 8 questions in this RACE.

`InSecureumApe` is adapted from a well-known contract. The question is below the shown contract.

### Question 1 of 8

The mint price of an `InSecureumApe` is:

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. $0.0008$ ETH  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. $0.008$ ETH  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. $0.08$ ETH  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. $0.8$ ETH  </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is D.**

We can see the price is determined by the `apePrice` constant in wei, by which the number of tokens to mint are multiplied by.

The inline comment claims it to be `//0.08 ETH` but, knowing that ethereum has 18 decimals, we can check and realize the price actually 0.8 eth.

The https://eth-toolbox.com/ website offers a quick way to convert between these denominations.

It would've been a lot better if the code made use of denominations, this would've made the code much more readable and likely prevented the issue: `0.08 ether`.

### Question 2 of 8

The security concern(s) with `InSecureumApe` access control is/are

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Owner can arbitrarily pause public minting of `InSecureumApes`  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Owner can arbitrarily mint `InSecureumApes`  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Single-step ownership change  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Missing event emits in and time-delayed effects of owner functions  </li>
</ul>


<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A, B, C, D.**

The `saleIsActive` state variable is checked within `mintApe()` can be toggled via the `flipSaleState()` by the owner at any time, without delay or warning.

The `reserveApes()` function allows the owner to mint arbitrary amounts of tokens at any time even bypassing the `MAX_APES` maximum supply config set during construction.

The `transferOwnership()` function inherited from OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract only ensures that ownership is not transferred to the zero-address, but it can be transferred in a single step to any other potentially invalid address.

None of the functions using the `onlyOwner` modifier emit events or have any sort of time-delay for their action, due to this users can suffer from unwanted surprises that are difficult to monitor for.

### Question 3 of 8

The security concern(s) with `InSecureumApe` constructor is/are

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Missing sanity/threshold check on `maxNftSupply`  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Missing sanity/threshold check on `saleStart`  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Potential integer overflow  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above  </li>
</ul>


<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A, B, C.**

None of the mentioned parameters are sanity/threshold checked which would allow accidental deployment with incorrect parameters that could be noticed too late, after money has already gone into the contract.

Unlike in Solidity 0.8.x, integer overflows aren't automatically checked for in this version, so an extremely high `saleStart` value could indeed cause an integer overflow, although unlikely for sane values. The best practice is to use a SafeMath library here.
</HiddenSolution>

### Question 4 of 8

The total number of `InSecureumApe`s that can ever be minted is

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. `maxApePurchase`  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. `MAX_APES`  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. `MAX_APES + 30`  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. `type(uint256).max`  </li>
</ul>


<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is D.**

Since the `reserveApes()` function allows the owner to arbitrarily mint tokens without checking the `MAX_APES` variable, it's possible to mint as many tokens as the `totalSupply` variable can hold, which is the maximum value an `uint256` can have.
</HiddenSolution>

---

### Question 5 of 8

The public minting of `InSecureumApe`s

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Must be paid the exact amount in Ether  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. May be performed 19 NFTs at a time  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Uses `_safeMint` to prevent locked/stuck NFTs  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above  </li>
</ul>


<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B, C.**

The amount doesn't need to be paid exactly, more can be sent but shouldn't since any above this amount is kept by the protocol and not sent back.

The contract doesn't correctly check how many tokens can be minted at a time, it should be `numberOfTokens <= maxApePurchase` to allow 20 as described.

The contract indeed uses the `_safeMint()` function that'll ensure that if the receiver is a contract, it must correctly implement the `onERC721Received()` function, proving that the receiver is capable of handling NFTs and that they won't be stuck after receiving them.
</HiddenSolution>

---

### Question 6 of 8

The security concerns with `InSecureumApe` is/are

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Use of a floating pragma and an older compiler version  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Oracle price manipulation  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Reentrancy allowing bypass of `maxApePurchase` check  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above  </li>
</ul>


<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A, C.**

The best practice is to avoid floating pragmas for contracts to ensure that they're always tested with the same Solidity version throughout the entire development cycle until deployment.

The contract does not make use of any oracles.

Since `_safeMint()` is used and calls `onERC721Received()` on receiving contracts, a NFT receiver can indeed call back into the `mintApe()` function and bypass how many tokens can be minted within a single transaction. But this check can be bypassed by simply repeatedly calling `mintApe()` from a custom contract since the function doesn't ensure that only EOAs can call it.
</HiddenSolution>

### Question 7 of 8

The starting index determination

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Is meant to randomize NFT reveal post-mint  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Can be triggered by the owner at any time  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. May be triggered only 9 days after sale start  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Accounts for the fact that EVM only stores previous 256 block hashes  </li>
</ul>


<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A, B, D.**

You can read about how this is used for post-mint reveal randomization in this article.

The 9-day delay of the `REVEAL_TIMESTAMP` variable can be overriden at any point in time, it can also be triggered earlier if the totalSupply matches `MAX_APES` exactly, or be triggered at any time by the owner via `emergencySetStartingIndexBlock()`.

It accounts for the block hash access limitation by falling back to using the hash of the previous block instead.


</HiddenSolution>

### Question 8 of 8

Potential gas optimization(s) in `InSecureumApe` is/are

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Caching of storage variables  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Avoiding initializations of variables to default values of their types  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Use of immutables  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above  </li>
</ul>


<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A, B, C.**

Whenever storage variables are read from multiple times, they should be cached in memory to safe gas. This is missing for `MAX_APES` in `mintApe()` and `startingIndexBlock` in `setStartingIndex()`.

All state variables are zero-initialized by default, therefore there's no need to manually set `saleIsActive` to false, for example.

The state variable `MAX_APES` is only set once during construction and should be immutable to save gas
