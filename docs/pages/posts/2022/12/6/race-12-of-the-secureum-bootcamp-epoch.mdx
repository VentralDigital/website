This is a Write-Up of RACE-12, Quiz of the [Secureum Bootcamp](https://twitter.com/0xRajeev/status/1470910752085065731) for Ethereum Smart Contract Auditors.

<Callout type="info">
  I once again had the honor of designing it and gave my best to find something that is both challenging and interesting. I imagine it was very hard to **solve all 8 questions within the strict timelimit of 16 minutes**, but I recommend you’ll try to see how far you come with using more time before looking at the solutions.

  As usual, I waited for submissions to close before publishing it and, to stay true to the original, I omitted syntax highlighting. Feel free to copy it into your favorite editor, but do so after starting the timer!

### Question 1 of 8

Sensible gas optimization(s) would be

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Making `MIGRATOR_ROLE` state variable `constant` </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Making `UNDERLYING` state variable `constant` </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Making `MIGRATOR_ROLE` state variable `immutable` </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Making `UNDERLYING` state variable `immutable` </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A, D.**

While `MIGRATOR_ROLE` can be made both `constant` or `immutable`, using `constant` makes the most sense since the value is known during compile time.

`UNDERLYING` on the other hand can only be `immutable` since the value is passed in during the contract's construction.
</HiddenSolution>

### Question 2 of 8

What would a caller with `MIGRATOR_ROLE` permission be capable of?

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Manipulating `TokenV1`'s storage </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Deleting `TokenV1`'s stored bytecode </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Changing `TokenV1`'s stored bytecode to something different </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. With the current code it's not possible for anyone to have `MIGRATOR_ROLE` permission </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A, B.**

A contract that was given the `MIGRATOR_ROLE` will be capable of triggering `TokenV1`'s `fallback` function which will delegate-call them back. During this delegate-call, the contract will be capable of manipulating storage as well as self-destructing `TokenV1`.

Replacing the bytecode would only be possible if `TokenV1` was deployed via `CREATE2`, allowing for a redeployment at the same address with a different bytecode.

The public `grantRole()` function is inherited from `AccessControl` and allows callers with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to grant the `MIGRATOR_ROLE` to any address.

### Question 3 of 8

`Vault` initialized with `TokenV1` as underlying

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Can be drained by re-entering during withdrawal </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Can be drained during withdrawal due to an integer underflow </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Allows stealing approved tokens due to a phantom (i.e. missing) function </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is C.**

A Vault initialized with `TokenV1` offers no opportunity to re-enter although the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern is not being followed. For this to be exploitable the underlying token itself must either be malicious or implement something akin to receive-hooks like ERC-777.

The fact that a Solidity version >0.8.0 is used without any `unchecked` blocks should prevent any integer over- or underflows from happening.

The `depositWithPermit()` function is relying on the call to `TokenV1`'s `permit()` method to revert if it's not implemented or the provided signature is invalid. However, `TokenV1`'s `fallback()` function will make any calls to `permit()` succeed, making `permit()` a "phantom function". With any calls succeeding an attacker would be able to make deposits using the allowances of other users without the need for a valid signature.
</HiddenSolution>

### Question 4 of 8

If `Vault` were to use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom` then

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. It would be able to safely support tokens that don't revert on error </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. It would ensure that tokens are only sent to contracts that support handling them </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. It would introduce a re-entrancy vulnerability due to receive hooks </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A.**

The way `Vault` is currently implemented, its deployer needs to be careful to not use a token as `underlying` that returns success booleans instead of reverting on error. Using the `SafeERC20` library would add the `saveTranserFrom()` function and allow both kinds of token implementations to be used.

Answers B and C talk about the "save" methods of NFT standards such as ERC721. These would check whether a receiving contract declares supporting them and would also offer an opportunity for re-entrancy via the `onERC721Received()` hook.
</HiddenSolution>

### Question 5 of 8

Who would need the `MIGRATOR_ROLE` for `TokenV2` to function as intended?

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. The deployer of the `TokenV2` contract </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. The `TokenV1` contract </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. The `TokenV2` contract </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. The `PermitModule` contract </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is C.**

The deployer of `TokenV2` would need `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` for granting it the `MIGRATOR_ROLE`.

`TokenV2` is the only contract that requires the role since it needs to (ab)use `TokenV1`'s fallback function trigger a delegate-call to the `PermitModule`'s contract.
</HiddenSolution>

---

### Question 6 of 8

With `TokenV2` deployed, a `Vault` initialized with `TokenV1` as `underlying`

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Is no longer vulnerable in the `depositWithPermit()` function </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Becomes more vulnerable due to a Double-Entry-Point </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Stops functioning because `TokenV1` has been replaced </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B.**

A `Vault` initialized with `TokenV1` will always be vulnerable in the `depositWithPermit()` function. A new `Vault` would need to start using `TokenV2` for the `depositWithPermit()` function to no longer be vulnerable to the `permit()`-phantom.

`TokenV2` now acts as a Double-Entry-Point for `TokenV1` (and vice versa). This can be exploited via the `sweep()` function which allows rescuing any stuck tokens as long as they are not the underlying token. Sweeping `TokenV2` on a `Vault` using `TokenV1` would effectively drain the `Vault`.
</HiddenSolution>

### Question 7 of 8

`Vault` initialized with `TokenV2` as underlying

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Can be drained by re-entering during withdrawal </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Can be drained during withdrawal due to a integer underflow </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Is not vulnerable in the `depositWithPermit()` function </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Is vulnerable due to a Double-Entry-Point </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is C, D.**

Answers A and B haven't changed from Question 3 with the introduction of `TokenV2`.

In `TokenV2` calling the `permit()` function will no longer call the `fallback` but its actual implementation from ERC20Permit. Therefore a `Vault` with `TokenV2` will no longer be vulnerable to the `permit()`-phantom.

`TokenV1` acts as a Double-Entry-Point for `TokenV2` (and vice versa). This can be exploited via the `sweep()` function which allows rescuing any stuck tokens as long as they are not the underlying token. Sweeping `TokenV1` on a `Vault` using `TokenV2` would effectively drain the `Vault`.
</HiddenSolution>

---

### Question 8 of 8

The `PermitModule` contract

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Acts as a proxy </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Acts as an implementation </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Allows anyone to manipulate `TokenV2`'s `balances` </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Can be self-destructed by anyone </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B, D.**

`TokenV2` will forward delegate-calls made from `TokenV2` to the `PermitModule` contract. Effectively `TokenV2` abuses the migration logic in `TokenV1` turning it into a proxy while `PermitModule` acts like the implementation.

The way that `Context`'s `_msgSender()` function has been overridden, it allows any caller to arbitrarily set what is expected to be the `msg.sender`. By crafting a call with `TokenV1`'s address appended they will gain the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. With that, they can grant themselves the `MIGRATOR_ROLE` and make `PermitModule` delegate-call back. Since all token balances are stored at `TokenV1`'s address this will not allow for a manipulation of any real balances. But it would allow delegate-calling to a contract that'll execute a self-destruct.
