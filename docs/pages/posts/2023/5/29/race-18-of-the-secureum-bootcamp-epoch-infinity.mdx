This is a Write-Up of RACE-18, Quiz of the [Secureum Bootcamp](https://twitter.com/0xRajeev/status/1470910752085065731) for Ethereum Smart Contract Auditors.   It was designed by Secureum Mentor [Josselin Feist](https://twitter.com/Montyly) from [Trail of Bits](https://twitter.com/trailofbits).

<Callout type="info">
  Participants of this quiz had to **answer 8 questions within the strict time limit of 16 minutes**. If you’re reading this in preparation for participating yourself, it’s best to give it a try under the same time limit!

  As usual, I waited for submissions to close before publishing it and, to stay true to the original, I omitted syntax highlighting. Feel free to copy it into your favorite editor, but do so after starting the timer!

<Callout type="info">
All 8 questions in this RACE are based on the below contract. This is the same contract you will see for all the 8 questions in this RACE. The question is below the shown contract.

### Question 1 of 8

What risk(s) should be considered when reviewing this contract?

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Reentrancy risks </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Logic bugs </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Front-running risks </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Arithmetic risks </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A, B, C, D.**

During an audit all risks should be **considered**! *(Duh)*

This question wasn't about what *issues* the contract actually has, but these specific issues will be asked about later in this quiz.
</HiddenSolution>

### Question 2 of 8

Which of the following statement(s) is/are true?

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. No overflow can ever occur in a contract compiled with solc version 0.8</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. `IERC20.decimals returns(uint256)`  is not a correct ERC20 function according to the  ERC20 specification</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. The contract does not follow Natspec for all the documentation</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above</li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B, C.**

* A: With Solidity version 0.8, overflows (eg. from addition or multiplication) can still happen within `unsafe` blocks.
* B: According to the ERC20 specification, the `decimals()` function should return `uint8`.
* C: It's not followed everywhere, eg.: The `mint()` function's `@param` is not following Natspec because it's missing one slash.
</HiddenSolution>

---

### Question 3 of 8

Which of the following is an/are invariant(s) that should hold true? (assuming no bug)

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. The contract's ether balance must be strictly equal to the sum of all the balances (in the `balances` mapping)</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. For any user, `minted[user] <= balances[user] * 10`</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. For any user, `token.balanceOf(user) == balances[user]`</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above</li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B.**

* A: Strict equality with a contract's ether balance is an invariant that would be broken by an injection of ether value into the contract (eg. via `SELFDESTRUCT`)
* B: This one will hold. A user is able to mint 10 times as many tokens as their ether balance. But they might have a larger balance than actually minted tokens. And most importantly, they should never have more minted token than what they have locked.
* C: A user could transfer their token balance breaking the invariant.
</HiddenSolution>

### Question 4 of 8

Which of the following sentence(s) is/are true regarding `getBalances`?

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. `getBalances(msg.sender)` returns the sender's balance</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. `getBalances` reverts if the user's balance is zero</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. `getBalances` always returns zero</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above</li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is C.**

While the function never reverts, it doesn't actually return the sender's balance. That's because the `balance` return variable is shadowed within the function's body (ie. a new variable with the same name is declared and used instead of the correct one). As the default value of unused variables is always zero-like the number returned by this function will always be 0 too.
</HiddenSolution>

---

### Question 5 of 8

Which of the following sentence(s) is/are true regarding the `balances` mapping?

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. An attacker can increase their `balances` (theft) from  `balances[victim]` </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. An attacker can reset `balances[victim]`</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. An attacker can increase their `balances` to any amount</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. An attacker cannot compromise the `balances` mapping</li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B.**

There are no vectors for A and C.

But the `depositTo()` function is mistakenly using `=` instead of `=+`, therefore resetting the destination's balance. Attacker's can use this to set the `balances[victim]` to arbitrary values, most likely very small ones.
</HiddenSolution>

---

### Question 6 of 8

Which of the following sentence(s) is/are true regarding reentrancies in this contract? 

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. `nonReentrant` protects the contract from reentrancies</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. A correct reentrancy protection modifier is not needed if `withdraw` is refactored to follow the CEI pattern</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. There are no reentrancy risks</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above</li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B.**

* A: The `nonReentrant` modifier is not correctly implemented and won't protect the contract from reentrancies. (Its require should check for strict equality)
* B: That's correct, following the CEI pattern would mean updating the user's balance before calling the `msg.sender`, making reentering the contract pointless.
* C: The `withdraw` function does not follow the CEI pattern at this moment and the reentrancy-guard is broken, therefore there is a reentrancy risk.
</HiddenSolution>

---

### Question 7 of 8

The `mint` function has the following risks (assuming there are no bugs in the other functions)

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. The user can generate tokens without having locked ether</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. An attacker can front-run a call to `mint` and make it revert</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. `minted[msg.sender] = amount * decimals_factor;` should be replaced by `minted[msg.sender] = amount / decimals_factor;`</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above</li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A.**

* A: Is possible by exploiting a loss of precision error due to division-before-multiplication in `_has_enough_balance()`. This effectively allows minting up to 9 tokens without locking any ether.
* B: There's nothing that a frontrunner could do to make a call to `mint` revert.
* C: That change would not make sense.
</HiddenSolution>

---

### Question 8 of 8

The `burn` and `_has_enough_balance` functions have the following risks (assuming there are no bugs in the other functions)

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. The user can unlock their balance without burning the underlying tokens</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. An attacker can front-run a call to `burn` and make it revert</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. `burn` should use `tx.origin` instead of `msg.sender` to prevent access control issues</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. None of the above</li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B.**

* A: No way to do this.
* B: Due to the strict equality requirement in `burn`, a frontrunner can transfer 1 wei of token to the user to make the burn-call revert.
* C: Making this change would likely make the contract less secure (opens phishing vector) and would also be bad for composability (only EOAs could be users).
