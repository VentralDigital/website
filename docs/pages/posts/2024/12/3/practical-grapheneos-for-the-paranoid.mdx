[GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) is a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) Operating System based on the [Android Open Source Project (AOSP)](https://www.android.com/), specifically focusing on improving privacy and security. Although we'd all like to have the best security and best privacy possible, it's an unfortunate fact that such improvements rarely come without a cost to convenience and usability. Here, we will explore how to get the most out of Graphene's improvements, and the impact of these measures on the user experience with practical solutions.

## Device Choice

Probably the most common question by those looking into the GrapheneOS project for the first time is: Why are only so few devices officially supported, and why the heck are all of them expensive Pixel phones made by evil Google?

#### Why only Pixel devices?

![Collage of current Pixel devices](./pixels.jpg)

According to GrapheneOS there currently simply isn't another reasonable choice.<R reference='183' /> GrapheneOS does not have contractual exclusivity for Google's devices<R reference='186' />, and neither are Pixels incredibly secure, it's rather that all the alternatives are downright awful.<R reference='167' /> The GrapheneOS project maintains a [list of detailed requirements](https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices) that they have for current and future officially supported devices<R reference='64' /><R reference='65' /> and, unfortunately, at this time only Pixels are able to meet them.

Pixel devices have first-class support for alternate operating systems<R reference='59' />, likely thanks to the fact that they serve as a reference for Android development.<R reference='134' /> They receive proper regular updates of their firmware<R reference='64' />, and offer advanced hardware security features such as memory tagging<R reference='64' /><R reference='167' /> which remain available even when non-stock operating systems are installed on them.<R reference='181' />

Most other OEMs on the other hand merely offer half-baked, partially working support for alternative operating systems, as they see it as a non-production hobbyist feature.<R reference='134' /> Heck, most of them completely skip basic security features and don't bother providing proper updates.<R reference='64' /> To make matters even worse, they often add lots of complexity and, with it, attack surface, with their overall changes to the system.<R reference='92' />

In the past, GrapheneOS has attempted partnering with OEMs but it turns out to be incredibly hard to make a device with comparable security to a Pixel. These partnerships fell through, in the end it was simply easier for these OEMs to make money by producing questionable hardware wallets for cryptocurrencies.<R reference='141' />

The only Android OEM even close to Pixel devices in terms of hardware security is Samsung.<R reference='92' /> They have even partnered up with Google to improve device security, with some success<R reference='126' />, but in the end Samsung still tends to lag behind by 2-3 years in shipping the new security features introduced by Pixels.<R reference='180' /> While Samsung is theoretically only missing a couple of the requirements, they still lack serious alternate OS support<R reference='59' /><R reference='64' />, which prevents GrapheneOS from using even those features that it has.<R reference='65' />

Broad device support would currently imply being available to very badly secured devices, unable to support many of Graphene's security features. It would also take away a substantial amount of resources from their work on privacy and security, due to a lot of it being rather hardware-specific.<R reference='123' /><R reference='280' /> However, if there were other devices complying with the requirements, the GrapheneOS project would certainly plan to support them.<R reference='155' />

#### Are there alternatives?

There are various alternate operating systems for Android devices with a focus on privacy and security, or at least a broader support of devices. Though, according to the GrapheneOS project, none of these can truly be considered viable alternatives.

The most basic critique the GrapheneOS team levies against pretty much all of them is the great delay and, in some cases, even complete omission of important security patches that users of the purely open source variant of Android (AOSP) would enjoy.<R reference='92' /><R reference='172' /> 

[LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) is one of these offenders, though granted, this project's focus is device longevity and broad compatibility rather than security<R reference='144' />. It's critically lacking verified boot, making it trivial to break into with physical access.<R reference='172' /> The [/e/OS](https://e.foundation/e-os/) project markets itself as fully "deGoogled" mobile ecosystem focusing on privacy while building upon Lineage's shaky foundation<R reference='90' />. The e/OS comes bundled with applications and services that give users a questionable feeling of privacy while these services themselves are arguably invasive.<R reference='159' />

Graphene's possibly greatest "competitor", [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) is apparently not only regularly behind on patches but has also misled users about this with inaccurate Android security patch levels.<R reference='91' /><R reference='92' /> They furthermore implemented security features with serious flaws, such as the panic-wipe feature that didn't reliably delete incriminating data as intended.<R reference='122' /><R reference='296' />

<Callout type="info">
  For further information on various Android-based Operating Systems, you may want to take a look the following comparison table created by a third party: https://eylenburg.github.io/android_comparison.htm
</Callout>

Then there is [CopperheadOS](https://copperhead.co/android/), the name under which GrapheneOS was formerly known. I will not go into detail on the drama behind the hostile takeover and eventual separation from the company that was intended to financially sponsor the project. It's noteworthy to mention though that this company now sells CopperheadOS as closed source fork.<R reference='184' />

Finally [Purism](https://puri.sm/) with their custom, optionally Made-In-USA, hardware that promises control over your privacy with features such as (questionable?<R reference='161' />) hardware switches. The GrapheneOS team strongly disagrees with the choice of hardware security components made for their devices and also with the convoluted process required for firmware and microcode updates.<R reference='140' /> Their Librem 5 device is nearly entirely closed source hardware and firmware<R reference='215' /> though many people have been misled to believe the opposite to be true.<R reference='88' />

GrapheneOS accuses these projects of empty marketing with buzzwords that mislead users into trusting both outdated and vulnerable soft- and hardware.<R reference='93' /><R reference='121' /><R reference='140' /> They even go so far as to say that users would be better off using an iPhone (in Lockdown mode<R reference='194' />) instead of any of the mentioned projects as the next best option for privacy and security after GrapheneOS.<R reference='89' /><R reference='92' /><R reference='125' /><R reference='126' /><R reference='191' />

Don't misunderstand, the GrapheneOS project does by no means claim that its operating system is impenetrable<R reference='168' /><R reference='199' />, but it does focus on substance rather than branding and marketing. This becomes quite clear when comparing Graphene's [website](https://grapheneos.org/) to those of other projects: GrapheneOS is an unapologetically technical project which I personally greatly appreciate as it saves me from having to dig through marketing to find the technical facts.<R reference='245' /> On the other hand, I can certainly see how this is rather intimidating to the average user.

#### Can Google devices be trusted?

We've covered that GrapheneOS currently only supports Pixel devices due to those being the only ones having sufficient hardware security measures in place. All well and good, but wouldn't that be pointless if those devices are backdoored?

As mentioned, Google's Pixels serve as reference devices for Android development, causing many experts to work with them.<R reference='134' /> Furthermore, Google has been very open to external security research, thanks to which Pixels have received great security research attention.<R reference='212' /> It would be arguably difficult to hide backdoors within the devices under these circumstances.

Another argument is that it would be far easier to attack the supply chains of tiny companies that outsource their manufacturing rather than compromise the global production of iPhone or Pixel devices without discovery. Users of such mainstream devices benefit from a lot of scrutiny that these devices receive.<R reference='179' /> It's also worth noting that leaks from forensic firms, that specialize in breaking into smartphones and are often hired by governments, do not offer any evidence for the existence of purposefully placed backdoors either.<R reference='198' /><R reference='199' />

Still, some argue against using anything made by Google out of principle. For the best chances to achieve this, they'd have to make use of Apple's products though, due to Google playing a huge part in the development of many open-source projects, including the Linux kernel itself.<R reference='182' /> The mission of GrapheneOS is not entirely centered around the idea of avoiding one particular company by any means necessary, rather it's to obtain the best possible privacy with the best possible tools available.<R reference='159' /> 

#### Which Pixel to choose?

For the best security, using a Pixel of the 8th or 9th generation is strongly recommended.<R reference='191' /><R reference='280' />  They are considered significantly more secure thanks to the hardware features that GrapheneOS can make use of, such as memory tagging.<R reference='169' /> The 9th generation comes with an additionally hardened<R reference='56' /> and more efficient cellular radio, so if you are planning to use it with a SIM card you can expect improved security and battery life.<R reference='66' /> The Pixel 9 Pros come with 16GB of RAM which will be especially useful if you're planning to use GrapheneOS with multiple user profiles (benefits of which will be explained later).<R reference='124' />

The 9th generation is currently also ahead in terms of the hardened Linux kernel used, but the 8th generation is likely to be upgraded soon making both generations very similar in terms of security.<R reference='170' /> With that in mind, a Pixel 8a phone will be the ideal budget device with some trade-offs in performance. Either way, both generations are receiving 7 years of full support.<R reference='62' />

<Callout type="info">
  You can find a table of how long each of the devices will be supported at https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-lifetime
</Callout>

Pixel devices of the 6th and 7th generation still have a few years of support left, making them a decent choice if you already own one and want to keep using it for a while longer. This is not a recommendation for buying a new one of these generations though.<R reference='169' /> Also, keep in mind that there are various security features that GrapheneOS can only make use of with the hardware of newer generations.<R reference='57' />

Anything older than that is considered End-Of-Life and the GrapheneOS project strongly recommends against continuing to use them<R reference='173' />, regardless of which operating system is used.<R reference='62' /> This is true even though GrapheneOS still provides extended support for some of them, which is merely intended for harm reduction to buy users some time to migrate to a fully supported device.<R reference='280' /> For example, there no longer are firmware patches and driver support for the Pixel 5a<R reference='100' />, and there's even a known, unpatched remote code execution vulnerability that could be exploited to take control of the device.<R reference='83' />

#### Self-Install or Pre-Installed?

There are companies selling Pixel devices with GrapheneOS preinstalled, but there are also some that claim or wrongly suggest that the operating system installed is GrapheneOS or using parts of it.<R reference='87' /> Additionally, there's a chance that such preinstall- or used devices have been tampered with.<R reference='86' />

GrapheneOS is not affiliated and does not endorse any of these companies and instead recommends buying a supported device and going through the installation process yourself.<R reference='291' /> Buying one at a local electronics store with cash will even allow you to do so anonymously.<R reference='125' /> Just make sure to avoid devices that are locked to a specific carrier.<R reference='213' />

The easiest method to install GrapheneOS is using a compatible web browser on a compatible second device - that can be a chromium browser on a laptop or even on a second Android phone!<R reference='267' /> You just need a cable to connect both devices. On the secondary device, you simply have to open the [web installer](https://grapheneos.org/install/web) page and follow the instructions. Don't worry: Your device will not lose its warranty<R reference='132' />, it'll not get bricked<R reference='297' />, and if you don't like GrapheneOS you can always go back to stock Android.<R reference='298' />

## Tamper Protection

#### Verified Boot Key Hash

Assuming you are now a proud owner of a Pixel device with a fresh GrapheneOS installation, you might be surprised by the warning greeting you when the device is started. It'll disappear and continue booting GrapheneOS after a few seconds unless you press the power button to pause the screen. The string of characters shown following "ID:" is called the *verified boot key fingerprint* which is a cryptographic hash value that allows you to verify that the GrapheneOS version installed is authentic - and it should never change!<R reference='235' />

The fingerprints differ depending on the device model and the above list of them was copied from the [web installer page](https://grapheneos.org/install/web#verified-boot-key-hash).<R reference='222' /> Although unlikely, it's possible that the server infrastructure of the GrapheneOS project was compromised and that attackers have replaced both the operating system files used during installation and the list of key hashes. You can compare the fingerprint displayed on your device with the table above to ensure that you've installed a legitimate version of GrapheneOS.<R reference='267' /><R reference='235' />

#### Auditor App

GrapheneOS comes bundled with the Auditor App. It's another way to validate the authenticity and integrity of the operating system to ensure that no tampering has occurred. You can execute a check manually with a second device that has the Auditor App installed. This does not need to be another GrapheneOS installation as you can [find the app on Google's Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.attestation.auditor.play&hl=en).<R reference='292' />

<ScreenshotCards num={2}>
  <ScreenshotCard

      <>![Thumbnail](./auditorapp-results.jpg)</>
  </ScreenshotCard>
</ScreenshotCards>

This verification can be automated using the [attestation.app](https://attestation.app/) website which is part of the GrapheneOS project. After registering on the website and pairing your device you'll receive an email alert if the device fails to provide valid attestations in time.<R reference='292' />

Sadly it's currently not possible to host your own remote attestation server as using it would require changes to the Auditor App.<R reference='299' />

## Hardening through Settings

There are three fundamental aspects on how GrapheneOS defends itself against security vulnerabilities: It reduces the amount of "surface" (ie. active functionality/code) that is exposed to potential attackers, makes the exploitation of vulnerabilities as difficult as possible, and sandboxes (ie. isolates) components from each other to decrease the impact of a vulnerability being exploited. As such measures impact usability and device performance, GrapheneOS allows users to choose their own preferences via various toggles in the settings.<R reference='244' /><R reference='248' />

#### The Lock Screen

User data is stored in an encrypted manner with a key that is derived from, among other things, your chosen screen lock-method. That these can't simply be bypassed using brute force is ensured by delays enforced by "secure element" hardware.<R reference='281' /> Thanks to this measure, even a random 6 digit PIN provides a high level of security. If you don't want to depend on the security of the secure element, you can make use of long passwords with up to 128 characters.<R reference='258' />

Unlocking using a pattern was removed from GrapheneOS as it is essentially a much worse version of a PIN and encourages unsafe pattern choices.<R reference='177' /> Instead, you should use at least a 6 digit PIN and consider turning on the PIN scrambling feature which raises the difficulty of figuring out the combination by an observer, fingerprint marks or side channels.<R reference='257' />

Fingerprint Unlock can be configured, though for best security you should consider restricting it to authentication within apps (ie. disabling *'Use for screen unlocking'*). The GrapheneOS team has announced that 2-factor fingerprint unlocking will be launching soon where unlocking the device will require both a fingerprint scan and the PIN/password.<R reference='45' />

If you have an eSIM or especially a physical SIM, it makes sense to configure a SIM PIN - though it should preferably be a different one than the one used for unlocking.<R reference='177' />

<ScreenshotCards num={2}>
  <ScreenshotCard

  </ScreenshotCard>
  <ScreenshotCard
    description="Screenshot of the Screen lock settings. You may want to consider disallowing camera access while the device is locked (ie. disabling the 'open camera on double power button press') to further reduce attack surface.">
      <>![Thumbnail](./settings-screenlock.jpg)</>
  </ScreenshotCard>
</ScreenshotCards>

Lastly, GrapheneOS offers setting a duress password/PIN. Once set, using it anywhere where a unlocking password or PIN can be entered, even in secondary user profiles<R reference='24' />, will irreversibly wipe the device (and installed eSIMs).<R reference='260' /> When triggered, information required for decryption is deleted and the device will shut down. On the next boot an invalid filesystem is detected and the device can be set up again as if it had been factory reset.<R reference='23' /> Note that this does not wipe the encrypted data itself as that would take a long time and gives attackers an opportunity to interrupt the process.<R reference='24' />

#### Auto-Reboot

A freshly booted device that hasn't been unlocked yet has its user data still fully encrypted, or "at rest". Continued use after the first unlock often leads to unencrypted data accumulating in the device's ephemeral memory, which is something that forensic companies exploit. The Auto-Reboot feature was introduced as a protection against the extraction of unencrypted data.<R reference='48' />

Although it's possible for applications to put sensitive data back to rest when the device locks, it's upon the developers to actually implement them that way - which rarely happens. Even the developers of the privacy-focused Signal messenger have shown little interest in implementing it, instead leaving it to forks like Molly to handle this in a better way. By automatically rebooting the device after some time, it is put back into a state of "before first unlock" (BFU).<R reference='49' />

The reboot timer starts every time the device is locked and successfully unlocking it resets the timer. By default, the timer is set to 18 hours with the lowest, and most secure, option available at 10 minutes.<R reference='55' /> Note that the timer will only start if the device has been unlocked at least once since the last reboot.<R reference='259' />

With the default value of 18 hours, the timer will be cancelled during consistent use to avoid impacting user experience. Due to GrapheneOS's very frequent updates requiring regular reboots in any case, this feature serves a secondary useful purpose.<R reference='73' /> If that still causes the device to reboot too often, the timer can be increased up to 78 hours or even completely disabled - though GrapheneOS strongly recommends against this.<R reference='44' />

Note that if you're planning to use secondary user profiles, this feature may be particularly annoying as all user sessions will be ended and the device resets back to the default Owner user.<R reference='224' />

#### USB Restrictions

When forensic companies attempt breaking into smartphones they typically prefer to do so via the USB interface which has a massive attack surface due to the many functions it offers.<R reference='54' /><R reference='128' /><R reference='176' /> Pixel devices offer hardware-level control over the USB-C port, a feature that isn't currently even used by the stock version of Android but a very important aspect to the GrapheneOS project.<R reference='181' />

<ScreenshotCards num={2}>
  <ScreenshotCard
    description="Screenshot: Many of these attack surface reducing options can be found under Settings &raquo; Security & Privacy &raquo; Exploit protection.">

  </ScreenshotCard>
  <ScreenshotCard
    description="Screenshot: The various available options for controlling the USB-C port will be enforced on both software and hardware level.">
      <>![Thumbnail](./exploitprotection-usbc.jpg)</>
  </ScreenshotCard>
</ScreenshotCards>

By default, GrapheneOS disables new USB-C connections as soon as the device is locked. In other words, you can plug in and use USB-C data while the device is unlocked, but once it's locked and you've pulled the plug it will reject new connections.<R reference='54' /><R reference='78' /> This measure includes disabling USB-C alternate modes such as DisplayPort.<R reference='249' />

The most secure, though arguably also the most inconvenient, option available is to fully disable the USB-C port while the operating system is running. This will even prevent any vulnerabilities present in the power delivery logic of the device, but will also require it to be turned off in order to be charged.<R reference='55' />

#### Wireless Attack Surface

With USB out of the picture that leaves wireless attack vectors such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular. However, getting into a device from any of these will be much harder and more complex.<R reference='54' /> Isolation of hardware components has become the de-facto norm for mobile devices.<R reference='135' /> Pixels even have separate chips for each of these radios, and if you wanted you could remove the chips individually and the device would be able to continue to function.<R reference='178' />

Although not yet enabled by default<R reference='69' />, you can set a timer to automatically turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The timer will begin once there's no longer an active connection. The GrapheneOS project is planning to extend this to NFC in the future as well.<R reference='55' />

The issue of cellular connectivity is a lot more complex. First off, 5G, SMS, MMS, and Calls generally work as fine on GrapheneOS as they would with stock Android.<R reference='279' /> GrapheneOS adds various toggles that once again attempt to reduce the attack surface<R reference='195' />, though depending on your carrier, and the country you're in, you may have to play around with them to see what works.<R reference='40' /><R reference='116' /><R reference='117' /><R reference='223' />

<Callout type="info">
  You can use eSIM with GrapheneOS but because it requires proprietary functionality from Google it is fully disabled by default.<R reference='277' /> Before, enabling eSIM support required Google Play<R reference='27' /><R reference='38' /> but this is no longer the case, and using eSIM now will not share any data with Google. Note that, while a wipe via distress PIN/Password also deletes the eSIM, the same is not true for a normal factory reset.<R reference='31' />
</Callout>

The GrapheneOS project recommends using the LTE-only toggle when possible.<R reference='275' /> LTE, which is sometimes referred to as 4G or 5Ge<R reference='279' />, is much more modern than the legacy 2G and 3G protocols, but also a lot less complex and more stable than the new 5G protocol.<R reference='209' /><R reference='129' />. Note that, although it may make some forms of interception more difficult, the only intention of the LTE-only mode is disabling an enormous amount of code related to both these legacy and bleeding edge protocols.<R reference='275' />

#### Cellular Privacy

LTE and 5G do come with a form of encryption, but this is mostly intended for the protection of the network itself and not for the protection of your privacy.<R reference='275' /> No matter which mode you're using, you should avoid traditional phone calls and text using the cellular network, and instead use end-to-end encrypted messengers such as Signal and SimpleX. In fact, if you can, always prefer using Wi-Fi over cellular.<R reference='101' /><R reference='106' /><R reference='160' />

The traditional telephone system is historically insecure and not designed with the goal of protecting user's privacy. You can imagine it like a walled garden where, once you've become a trusted party with access into it, you gain a significant amount of information and control over the network. This access can be bought for a few thousand USD per month and allows intercepting phone calls, SMS messages, and in some cases even roughly tracking someone's location. To do that an attacker needs your SIM card's unique IMSI identifier, but often it can be looked up simply by knowing your phone number. Using this the attacker would be able to intercept a 2-factor-authentication SMS while ensuring that your phone would not give any indication that such an SMS was ever sent to your number at all.<R reference='129' /><R reference='283' /><R reference='300' />

When your phone authenticates with the cellular network it does so while providing information on both your SIM card and the device's cellular radio hardware. If you've bought both the phone and SIM anonymously, you're essentially using a persistent pseudonym. Since hardware information is being shared, replacing the SIM alone is not sufficient for a fresh identity.<R reference='96' /><R reference='125' /><R reference='127' />

At this point, you might be considering using an external device, like a dedicated mobile hotspot, which would be much cheaper to regularly swap out together with a new SIM card. While this will increase your privacy, it will hurt your security as these devices typically have much worse hardware isolation and are way behind on security updates.<R reference='127' /> Compared to using the isolated internal radio of your Pixel, this will make it much easier for an attacker to gain control over the dedicated device, and if it is connected to your Pixel via USB this opens up a massive surface for attacking your phone.<R reference='99' /><R reference='128' /><R reference='135' /><R reference='176' />

Some of these dedicated cellular devices allow spoofing the IMEI, ie. changing the hardware identifier to an arbitrary value. This would allow you to reuse the same dedicated device and simply change the IMEI value together with a new SIM card for obtaining a new identity on the network. You should know however that the IMEI is not the only hardware-specific identifier that cellular radios leak and, furthermore, there are ways to create "fingerprints" of these devices that could allow re-identifying them even with identifiers changed. In the worst case, you could even draw a lot of attention to yourself when the spoofing is too obvious.<R reference='96' /><R reference='97' /><R reference='98' /><R reference='128' />

The GrapheneOS project does not recommend using a secondary device for cellular communication, but if you really want to do it then it would be better to use another Pixel device with GrapheneOS installed for it.<R reference='97' /> Note that if you're sharing cellular Internet via Wi-Fi, it's possible that someone nearby tracks your movements by tracking the signals of your Wi-Fi access point.<R reference='128' />

**What about airplane mode?**

Airplane mode is the only way to fully disable the cellular radio transmit, receive, and tracking capabilities of your device, and works appropriately on all Pixels. Once in airplane mode, Wi-Fi can be re-enabled and used without activating the cellular radio again.<R reference='106' /><R reference='283' /> If you intend to use your Pixel as a Wi-Fi-only device, you should consider removing the quick tile (the airplane-mode toggle visible when swiping down the status top-bar) so that you won't re-enable it by accident.<R reference='197' />

You should be aware that cellular is not the only way carrier services can be used. Remember that there's Wi-Fi calling and texting. To prevent the SIM from authenticating with the carrier and using their network services via other Internet connections, you need to disable the SIM itself.<R reference='96' /><R reference='101' /><R reference='197' />

Newer devices have special offline tracking systems intended to locate lost devices. GrapheneOS does not support and will not support these systems. If you want to be absolutely certain, you may consider keeping it within a faraday bag while you're not using it.<R reference='97' /><R reference='228' />

**What about using a data-only SIM?**

It doesn't particularly matter whether you're using a data-only SIM card in terms of privacy, you're still authenticated to the cellular network. Not having texts and calls however does reduce attack surface for exploits. GrapheneOS may in the future add toggles to disable these capabilities to practically turn normal SIM cards into data-only equivalents.<R reference='171' />

**What about using a VPN?**

Using a VPN has no influence on carrier-based calls or texts. These functions will not go through the VPN even if you are using a Wi-Fi connection instead of cellular.<R reference='234' />

**What about data-saver mode?**

Enabling the data-saver toggle will globally (ie. in all user profiles) stop apps from using cellular data in the background. Apps that use foreground services, meaning those apps that keep themselves running in the foreground via a permanent notification, are excluded from this restriction. Mobile data use can also be restricted per app.<R reference='196' />

**What about using no SIM?**

If you have no SIM card, and you are not in airplane mode, your device will still connect to the cellular network but it will not authenticate and should also not share any hardware identifiers. You will still be able to make emergency calls and receive emergency alerts. Note that making an emergency call will share radio identifiers of your device.<R reference='197' />

**What about emergency alerts?**

Emergency alerts are sent out through the cellular network to all connected phones, even if it has no SIM. Normally, only airplane mode prevents receiving them.<R reference='95' /> Because GrapheneOS is not subject to typical regulations it provides toggles for turning off even alerts of "presidential" priority.<R reference='189' />

#### App Exploit Protection

So far we've discussed how to protect our device from outside threats, but it's just as important to ensure that none of the installed applications can take over from the inside. Apps on Android always run isolated within their own sandbox<R reference='233' />, limiting the resources they can access to those that they have been given permission for.<R reference='301' /> Malicious apps may request and use permissions for purposes unrelated to the app's core functionality, others may even attempt breaking out of their sandbox. Often the application itself is not even intentionally malicious at all but has a vulnerability or its supply chain is being attacked.<R reference='248' />

Under *App Exploit Protection* you can find various measures that will increase the difficulty of an application breaking out of its sandbox. Many of them are not enabled for user-installed apps by default because they may cause those apps to crash or not work properly. But it's better to turn them on by default globally and then turn them off selectively for those apps that have trouble.<R reference='32' /><R reference='56' />

There are other measures that are implicitly always turned on.<R reference='256' /> One of them is the use of ahead-of-time compilation instead of just-in-time compilation. This saves battery life, improves the performance of many apps and, generally, is another important security feature. It has a drawback though: App installations and updates will take a lot longer than on stock Android.<R reference='220' /><R reference='221' />

**Permissions**

In stock Android, permissions only exist for accessing the Camera, Microphone, Body Sensors, and Activity Recognition. Access to accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, barometer, thermometer, and any other sensors are simply given to apps by default without requiring any explicit consent. GrapheneOS adds a toggle to prevent access to these sensors being given by default. Since this too can cause crashes in applications that expect to receive valid data from these sensors, this measure is not active in a fresh GrapheneOS installation. Turning it on will notify you when apps attempted accessing such a sensor and you'll be able to selectively grant this permission according to your own judgment.<R reference='252' />

Another permission that stock Android implicitly grants to all applications is access to networking functions. This includes device-local networking (localhost) which is currently a known way to bypass user profile isolation and allows apps of different profiles to communicate with each other. In GrapheneOS you'll be asked whether you want to grant this permission during the installation of an app. When the Network permission is not granted to an app, GrapheneOS pretends the network is down, which is usually handled by apps in a graceful manner.<R reference='252' />

Just like you can disable app exploit protections on a per-app basis, you can take away permissions from apps according to your own judgment. Be careful to not remove any permissions from system apps that are installed by default though, as this can cause unforeseen issues.<R reference='230' />

**Scoped Access**

There are popular apps that demand rather invasive permissions such as access to all contacts or all files on the device. Graphene's scope functionality allows selecting a subset of contacts or files to which access is granted while the app in question will believe to have been given access to everything.<R reference='269' />

By default, contact scopes act as if the contacts list is empty and users can then grant different kinds of access to specific contacts or groups of contacts.<R reference='255' /> Access to contacts is quite granular, allowing you to only share specific data with the app instead of the full contact info.<R reference='75' />

Users can enable storage scopes instead of granting the storage permission to apps.<R reference='254' /> This will have the effect that the app can't see any of the files that were created by other apps, unless the user explicitly specifies files or directories that it should be allowed full access to.<R reference='268' />

The GrapheneOS project is planning to add similar access scopes for other things such as Location, Camera, and Microphone.<R reference='76' />

**Microphone & Camera toggles**

Although these are available in stock Android too, it might be noteworthy that there are toggles for disabling access to the microphone and camera. They are also available as quick tiles when swiping down the status top-bar.

While it might be tempting to disable access to these globally and only turn them on when needed, this might end up being very inconvenient when you quickly intend to snap a photo (eg. via the power button double-press shortcut) or when you want to accept a call while the phone is still locked. In these cases, you'd first have to unlock the phone and enable the appropriate access, which could take so long that the person calling decides to hang up. Instead, you could leave the system-wide access to microphone and camera enabled and deny these permissions at a per-app level: Leaving them enabled for the phone and camera app while setting all others to 'Ask every time'.<R reference='219' />

If you're certain that you'll never need any of these sensors anyway, you could even buy one of [Nitrokey](https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/nitrophone-5-pro-712?search=nitrophone#attr=1497,1502,1501)'s modified Pixel phones where the hardware components have been physically removed.<R reference='161' />

#### System Updates

GrapheneOS system-update download and installation is automatic and happens seamlessly in the background.<R reference='265' /> A reboot is still needed for them to take effect<R reference='73' />, but this process comes without risk thanks to the automatic rollback if the first boot of the updated operating system fails.<R reference='265' />

Automatic reboots after an update are possible but disabled by default as these could happen in the middle of a phone call.<R reference='239' /> If you want to avoid updates being downloaded using cellular data, you should change the *'Permitted networks'* setting to *'Unmetered'* only.<R reference='231' /> Some users have reported that updates heavily drain the battery and cause the device to heat up, which can especially get in the way while you're not home. You can turn on the *'Require device to be charging'* toggle to avoid such cases.<R reference='227' />

<ScreenshotCards num={2}>

      <>![Thumbnail](./systemupdater-app.jpg)</>
  </ScreenshotCard>
</ScreenshotCards>

It's possible to completely disable automatic updates by disabling the *'System Updater'* app.<R reference='271' /> The GrapheneOS project strongly recommends against this, as you won't be getting privacy and security patches fixing vulnerabilities or adding improvements.<R reference='203' />

Some may be concerned whether a future update could introduce a backdoor. There are several measures in place to prevent malicious updates: They must have a valid cryptographic signature, which is enforced by both the update client as well as the verified boot mechanism. Things like downgrade attacks are also prevented locally.<R reference='16' />

The GrapheneOS project further argues that existing legislation can only target individual users, and cannot coerce malicious updates to be deployed to all GrapheneOS devices.<R reference='9' /> Because the updater doesn't provide any uniquely identifiable device information while requesting system updates, GrapheneOS won't be able to comply with a government's demand to send a backdoored update to a specific user. The update server will however be able to see the requester's IP address, which can be obfuscated by using a VPN or Tor.<R reference='270' />

#### Backups

GrapheneOS comes with [Seedvault](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault) integrated at *Settings &raquo; System &raquo; Backup* as a solution for creating backups or moving from one device to another. Bear in mind that if you're using secondary user profiles, you'll need to set it up in each profile separately.<R reference='240' /> Some apps like Signal or Molly use a type of encryption of their application's database that can only be backed up and restored through these apps themselves.<R reference='46' /> If you're planning to use a USB drive to store your backups, a common best practice is initially creating the backup in the device's internal storage, and only moving it over to the drive once it has finished.<R reference='240' />

There's also a known issue where backing up user files from storage might not include all of your files, therefore you shouldn't rely on Seedvault to include all of your important files yet. You may want to backup your important files separately, eg. to your laptop using a USB connection (*Use USB for 'File Transfer'*). But here too you'll have to establish the connection for each profile separately. GrapheneOS is hoping to replace Seedvault with a better and more reliable solution in the future, although there are currently tasks that have higher priority.<R reference='205' />

## Secondary User Profiles

User profiles mimic having separate phones to allow multiple users to share the same device.<R reference='192' /> In the following, we'll be exploring how this can be used to isolate apps from each other and compartmentalize the user's data. Though before that, I'd like to point out that the isolation that the app sandbox provides and the compartmentalization offered by access scopes will already be sufficient for many users.

On a freshly installed GrapheneOS, multiple users are disabled by default. Even so, when you unlock your phone after booting, you'll log into the "Owner" user, as in "The user who is the owner of the device". The Owner user shouldn't be mistaken for something like a privileged "root" user from Linux. Although the Owner has more administrative control over the device than other users, regular apps have the same access when running in Owner as they would in any other user profile.<R reference='192' />

Each user is encrypted with their own keys protected by their respective lock method.<R reference='261' /> The Owner user is special in the sense that it does not only store the Owner's data, but also sensitive system-wide operating system data. Because of this, you always need to unlock the Owner profile first before any other user profile can be used. The Owner profile, and the apps running within it, will always be running in the background while you're using another profile. Nonetheless, the Owner profile does not have any access to the data stored in other profiles.<R reference='281' />

</ScreenshotCards>

**Cross-Profile Notifications**

As visible in the screenshot above, it's noteworthy that you can actually receive notifications from another profile that is running in the background. Although the notification will only tell you in what profile it happened and by what app it was triggered, this is still an addition by GrapheneOS that significantly improves the user experience with secondary user profiles.<R reference='7' /><R reference='25' />

**Example Use Cases**

Before continuing on the different types of user profiles available, we should first discuss what even the advantages of using multiple profiles, compared to only using the Owner profile, are.

First of all, after setting up a new user you'll be greeted by a phone that appears to be in the state of being started for the first time. None of the user-apps you've already installed are there, everything is empty.<R reference='261' /> This can be very useful if you want to log into different users of the same application, eg. if you want to use a messenger with multiple accounts, but the app does not support that, you can simply install it twice in different profiles.<R reference='233' />

Separating apps between different profiles will also prevent them from easily being able to communicate with each other. For example, there's the normal Facebook platform app but also the separate Facebook Messenger app. If both apps agree to it, they can use something akin to inter-process communication to exchange information between each other - but only if both of them are running within the same user profile.<R reference='25' /><R reference='261' />

As mentioned, if you have apps that run in the background of your Owner profile, they will always be running unless you manually stop them from doing so. If you have applications that you rarely make use of, it makes sense to install them in a secondary user profile. Once you're done with them you can hold the device's power button and you'll be offered to end that user's session. This will make sure that all apps of that profile are stopped and their data is put to rest and fully encrypted.<R reference='281' />

You can also create and use user profiles only temporarily and immediately delete them afterward. As apps installed within one user are not aware of the other users, you can use profiles like a browser's incognito mode. A profile's filesystem is completely isolated from other profiles, and although you could set up a storage scope to achieve the same, there'll be no need to do that since your temporary profile will be empty.<R reference='282' />

Further above, we've talked about how the Auto-Reboot feature was added to ensure that data is eventually put to rest and no unencrypted data will be available for forensic companies to extract. If you employ a secondary user profile instead of the Owner for your regular usage, this will be much less of a problem: While putting the Owner's data at rest requires a reboot, putting a secondary user's data at rest simply requires ending their session.<R reference='281' />

**Number of User Profiles**

GrapheneOS raises the limit on the number of secondary user profiles from the standard 4 to 32, where one of them is always reserved for the guest user.<R reference='114' /><R reference='261' /> However, being able to create so many user profiles does not mean that all of them can run concurrently as that would impact the device's performance rather negatively. GrapheneOS scales the number of maximum concurrent users based on the amount of RAM built into the device.

<Bleed>
|                       | Pixel 9 Pro Fold   | Pixel 9 Pro XL  | Pixel 9 Pro     | Pixel 9        | Pixel 8 Pro | Pixel 8 & 8a |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| RAM                   | 16 GB              | 16 GB           | 16 GB           | 12 GB          | 12 GB       | 8 GB         |
| # Concurrent Profiles | 14                 | 14              | 14              | 10             | 10          | 6            |
</Bleed>

If you have user profiles for use cases where it's never necessary for that user to keep running in the background, you can un-toggle *'Allow running in background'* when editing that user via the Owner profile. That way you don't have to explicitly end the user's session, because simply switching away from that user will put the profile to rest.

**Cross-Profile App installation**

You might be surprised to find out that it's possible for user profiles to update each other's apps, and also for the Owner user to be able to install his app into another profile. Didn't we say that the file systems of each profile are completely isolated? Well, yes - but it's not like each profile is running on a completely independent operating system, and it turns out that the code of applications isn't actually stored within each user but in the underlying system that is shared between all of them.<R reference='113' />

The fact that the Owner is able to install apps in other profiles as long as they're already installed on the Owner means that we don't actually need to install app stores in every profile to get the apps we need. Instead, we could use the Owner profile as an "App Command Center"<R reference='232' />: We install app stores solely in the Owner user. When we install new apps we uncheck giving them the Network permission and immediately mark them as disabled.<R reference='263' /> Then we open the user management and install the newly installed apps into the profile where we'll actually use them.

**Drawbacks**

There are some inconveniences that come from making active use of secondary user profiles. For example, the Auto-Reboot feature will cause all user sessions to end and throws you back to unlocking the Owner profile first. That also means that all apps in those profiles will be forced to stop running and you'll miss out on receiving notifications from them until you log back into that user. Assuming you didn't set a very short time for Auto-Reboots, this shouldn't happen too often though.<R reference='224' />

As mentioned, the file systems of profiles are completely isolated, which means there's no native way to eg. share a meme that you saw on social media in one profile via a messenger that is running in another profile. Typical workarounds include having [cloud-based file synchronization](https://cryptomator.org/) or a messenger installed within both profiles - but that will require an Internet connection and potentially wastes your mobile data. You could set up local file synchronization using apps like [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-android) or an FTP server+client app - but these are usually annoying to set up. If you're already on Linux with a KDE desktop you might as well use [KDE Connect](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/) to exchange files between all of your devices and profiles. If not, the [Inter Profile Sharing](https://github.com/VentralDigital/InterProfileSharing) app I've built out of frustration on this issue will hopefully be your best friend. If you really want to avoid installing any apps for this, your best option is getting a USB Stick with a USB-to-USB-C adapter.<R reference='302' />

If you're installing apps in secondary profiles that require SMS verification, you might need to temporarily enable *'Turn on phone calls & SMS'* for that user.<R reference='225' />

#### Private Space

The private space feature is a recent addition to Android.<R reference='67' /> Technically this is simply a secondary user profile that is nested within the Owner profile: When the space is locked, the private profile user is stopped, and when the space is unlocked, the user profile is started. Except for the shared clipboard with Owner, it's separated the same way as a secondary user profile.<R reference='109' /><R reference='293' />

The advantage of using a private space over a secondary user profile is that the UI, in places such as notifications and settings, will be "merged" while the space is unlocked. That means if there's a notification from within the private space, it will be fully displayed in the Owner profile (compared to normal secondary users where this will only show the user and app name). While this makes it slightly less isolated than a dedicated user, private spaces can be a lot more convenient.<R reference='7' /><R reference='111' /><R reference='112' />

Compared to having up to 31 secondary user profiles, a device can only have a single private space and it must always be part of the Owner.<R reference='114' /><R reference='124' /><R reference='293' /> The GrapheneOS project is considering changing this though, among other improvements for private spaces.<R reference='67' /><R reference='120' /> It's also noteworthy that the private space user is not listed within the user management interface, meaning features such as installing Owner apps into the private space are not available. Furthermore, locking the private space does not purge the encryption keys as well as ending a secondary user's session would.<R reference='6' />

A drawback of private spaces, compared to full secondary user profiles, is that it's not possible to grant it access to *'phone calls & SMS'*. This prevents verification via SMS from working and prohibits using some apps within private spaces.<R reference='13' /><R reference='110' />

#### Work Profile

Work profiles are similar to private spaces in terms of user experience. They were originally designed for BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) deployments for corporations, which is why you need a separate "device manager app" to create them.<R reference='233' /> This app, and through it the corporation it belongs to, has control and ownership over the data within the work profile. However there are local management apps, such as [Shelter](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.typeblog.shelter/)<R reference='124' />, that allow the creation and management of a work profile without an external owner.<R reference='120' /> Either way, you'll always have to place trust in a third-party app to use work profiles, unless you program your own.<R reference='233' />

GrapheneOS calls work profiles created by apps like Shelter a "poor man's private space"<R reference='120' />, and strongly recommends using real private spaces instead.<R reference='109' /> Like private spaces, you can only have one and it must be located in the Owner profile. It's absolutely possible to use both a work profile and a private space alongside each other though.<R reference='102' /><R reference='114' /> 

Private spaces have better isolation, proper encryption, and better user interface integration with the Owner profile.<R reference='109' /><R reference='120' /> Work profile management apps can enable a lot of communication between the Owner user and the nested work profile.<R reference='113' /> For example, work profiles do not block the communication of applications between profiles, which may increase convenience but negatively impacts privacy and security.<R reference='233' />

#### VPN

For using VPNs the general best practice is that each of your devices should have a separate VPN connection that will obtain a separate exit IP address. <R reference='247' /> Because of this, all profiles (including work profiles and private spaces) have their own VPN configuration by design. This prevents an external party from tying them together based on the same exit IP address.<R reference='237' />

You can prevent a profile from ever directly accessing an Internet connection by enabling the *'Always-on VPN'* and *'Block connections without VPN'* toggles by default.<R reference='266' /> GrapheneOS has made many improvements to Android to prevent connections from leaking, ie. bypassing a VPN connection. Although there are still some known cases of VPN leaks, fixing these is one of the top priorities of the GrapheneOS project.<R reference='264' /> These toggles can even be exploited to create a secondary user profile that has no Internet access at all, if you have a use case for that.<R reference='242' />

At the moment, the GrapheneOS project only recommends using the official WireGuard app and the official Mullvad app. Mullvad is generally preferable though, as it works well with Graphene's exploit protection features turned on.<R reference='246' /><R reference='286' /> To avoid fingerprinting and tracking, GrapheneOS recommends using the default, network-provided DNS servers to blend in with other users.<R reference='285' />

Remember that while each profile has its own VPN configuration, the underlying networking is shared. Because of that, it's currently possible for apps with the Network permission to communicate across profiles via localhost, which is what I'm using for the Inter Profile Sharing app to function. But this will likely change in the future as the GrapheneOS project is planning to introduce separate network namespaces for each profile.<R reference='193' />

## Apps

A fresh install of GrapheneOS comes with a very minimal amount of apps, and there are several reasons for that: Bundling additional apps with the operating system will increase the attack surface right from the beginning, GrapheneOS prefers users to be able to choose which apps they want to install based on their own judgment. GrapheneOS is focused on meaningful improvements to privacy and security, bundling more apps into the operating system would likely not only be outside that focus but even counter to it. GrapheneOS also wants to avoid bundling apps and services of third parties as few of those would actually be aligned with its goals and values.<R reference='157' /><R reference='174' /><R reference='290' />

You may notice that among these few apps, GrapheneOS actually comes with its own 'App Store'. Note that this app repository is mostly intended for the distribution of Graphene's own first-party applications, and hardened versions of externally developed open-source apps. The list of available applications will be purposefully kept minimal, while third-party apps should seek to be included in Accrescent - the officially endorsed app store of GrapheneOS, which can be installed via Graphene's minimal store.<R reference='84' /><R reference='143' /><R reference='262' />

#### Bundled Apps

Of the few apps that GrapheneOS comes with, about half of them are inherited from the Android Open Source Project with minor changes and are very primitive in terms of functionality and user experience. Many of the AOSP apps were great choices 10+ years ago when Android's UI was more primitive and expectations were far lower. Over time Google replaced them with more modern versions for their stock OS but abandoned the open-source versions.<R reference='185' /> GrapheneOS is planning to overhaul or replace them as well, though there are often licensing issues with possible alternatives.<R reference='174' />

If you prefer Google's versions of apps such as the Camera, Gallery, and Keyboard, you can absolutely switch back to them without opting into their invasive usage statistic reporting and without uploading your photos to their service.<R reference='94' /> Some of Google's stock Android apps, such as the screenshot editor (Markup) and the Thermometer (for Pixels with the appropriate sensor), are mirrored in Graphene's App Store as they're not available in the Play Store.<R reference='85' />

**Camera**

The Camera app that GrapheneOS comes with has already been modernized<R reference='174' />, it's focused on privacy and security and is arguably better than any of the open-source alternatives and even most paid apps. It includes modes for capturing images, videos, and QR/barcode scanning.<R reference='273' /> It has basic HDR+, Night mode, multi-camera zoom, EIS, etc. There's no loss in terms of photo quality of the camera by running GrapheneOS instead of stock Android.<R reference='131' />

But still, it does not have the full set of features offered by the stock 'Pixel Camera' app. The Pixel Camera, previously Google Camera, can take full advantage of all available cameras and image processing hardware on GrapheneOS.<R reference='188' /><R reference='204' />Though to reduce attack surface, direct access to low-level hardware by Google's Apps is controlled by an extra toggle.<R reference='273' /> The *'Special access to hardware accelerators for Google apps'* toggle is enabled by default but does not grant these apps any additional access to data.<R reference='188' />

**Gallery**

GrapheneOS is planning to completely replace the current AOSP Gallery app, unfortunately, there's currently none available that has both acceptable licensing and proper image editing.<R reference='174' /> If you are looking for a good open-source alternative, Graphene as mentioned [IacobIonut01/Gallery](https://github.com/IacobIonut01/Gallery/blob/main/README.md) and [Aves](https://github.com/deckerst/aves/blob/develop/README.md).<R reference='185' />

You can also install the 'Google Photos' app, that you'd get with stock Android, via the Google Play Store. It'll be able to make use of most of the AI features as well as hardware acceleration.<R reference='85' /><R reference='207' /><R reference='210' /><R reference='211' />

**Keyboard**

Graphene's default keyboard is essentially Google's Gboard from 2014. It used to be an open-source project with a few closed-source components but ended up becoming entirely closed-source and rebranded to Gboard. It's missing some features such as sliding on the space bar to move the cursor, one-handed mode, better handling of emojis, and especially swipe typing.

Google's modern Gboard is definitely one of the nicest keyboards at the moment. Using it is fine as long as you don't opt-in to usage statistics and other invasive options. Remember that active keyboards have access to all the text you're entering, the text you're editing and the clipboard contents at all times.

If you're looking for an open-source alternative, you should have a look at [FlorisBoard](https://florisboard.org/). Its user interface isn't very polished yet, but it's an improvement in terms of features compared to the default keyboard. The GrapehenOS project is considering forking and moving to it in the future.<R reference='94' />

**Vanadium Browser**

GrapheneOS includes their Vanadium subproject which is based on Chromium with enhancements in privacy and security. It's used by both the operating system as default browser as well as by other apps that need to render web contents. The GrapheneOS project recommends this browser to be used as is; additional browser extensions or modifications are only likely to make you stand out more, making you easier to track. To prevent websites from accessing standard sensors, you can toggle off the 'Sensors' permission for the browser app as a whole.<R reference='272' />

#### App compatibility

There's currently only a tiny subset of Android apps incompatible with GrapheneOS. These are specifically apps that make use of the Play Integrity API which requires the operating system to be officially certified by Google. This mainly affects apps of banking/financial nature, location-based competitive games like Ingress, as well as some strange outliers such as the McDonalds app, Authy, and the Uber app for drivers. By implementing it, these apps have chosen to ban the use of alternative and modified operating systems. While this makes somewhat sense for games as basic anti-cheat system, it is by far not as effective as Google makes it out to be.<R reference='72' /> <R reference='130' /><R reference='133' /><R reference='136' /><R reference='156' />

This also prevents NFC payments made via Google Pay. A simple way around this restriction is using a Pixel or Galaxy Smart Watch paired with GrapheneOS.<R reference='115' /> Fortunately, there are other services, such as those provided by European banks, that have their own tap-to-pay which works on GrapheneOS.<R reference='29' /><R reference='68' /> For the US there's hope that Curve Pay will be available soon.<R reference='115' /><R reference='130' />

Although GrapheneOS provides the same standard security model as stock Android does, Google certifies operating systems not based on security but whether they licensed it.<R reference='79' /> There are ways to bypass some of these restrictions, but they would likely be blocked in time and would only be a temporary workaround.<R reference='70' /> According to the GrapheneOS project, the only permanent solution is regulatory or legal action based on this being highly anti-competitive and illegal behavior.<R reference='71' /><R reference='103' /><R reference='206' />

**Play Services Dependency**

Another caveat to Graphene's app compatibility is that some applications have a dependency on Google's Play Services, which is most often the case for messengers and social media. The reason for this is that they rely on receiving events for notifications through Google servers via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Some of these apps are able to fall back to their own implementation of push messages or frequent polling, but this typically requires the app to run with a foreground service. The app may also require being given 'Unrestricted' background usage, otherwise it'd be interrupted by the automatic battery optimization, causing delayed notifications.<R reference='238' /><R reference='288' />

An example of this is Signal, which will fall back to its own push mechanism when FCM is not available. There have however been reports that this performs badly and inefficiently (draining the battery). Instead, the alternative [Molly](https://molly.im/) client is often recommended for use without Play Services.<R reference='33' />

For apps that have a hard dependency on Play Services, you have the option to install and use the official Google Play Services restricted to the standard app sandbox. Thanks to the compatibility layer Google Play will receive absolutely no special access or privileges on GrapheneOS. It provides nearly complete compatibility aside from a small subset of functionality that hasn't been ported yet or cannot be provided due to being inherently privileged. The Play Store and its services are fully available, including in-app purchases and app/content license checks. It can install, update, and uninstall apps as usual, assuming it has been given authorization as an app source and consent for each action.<R reference='250' />

To make use of the compatibility layer, install 'Google Play services' from the GrapheneOS App Store. This will also install the Play Store, which is a dependency of Play services (don't disable the store app or the services will stop working too).<R reference='238' /> While making use of the Play Store requires being logged in with a Google Account, there's no need to log in if you're only installing Play Services for app compatibility reasons.<R reference='276' /> Also note that some apps including Signal need to be installed *after* sandboxed Google Play in order to make use of it properly.<R reference='104' />

After installing Play Services you'll get a *'Missing optional permission'* notification from the compatibility layer. Tapping it will ask whether you want to allow Google Play services to always run in the background, which will keep a connection open to Google's FCM server for reliable notifications, but will also reduce battery life. Agreeing to this will set the background usage to 'Unrestricted'. Leaving it on 'Optimized' will heavily restrict background usage based on how much it is used, while disallowing it will prevent background usage near totally. Make your choice depending on how important push notification timeliness via FCM is to you.<R reference='226' />

In terms of security, it does not make much of a difference in which user profile you install Play Services. If you're hoping to avoid Google as much as possible, it's best to install it in a profile that you're not planning to use as your main profile.<R reference='276' /> For example, if you were planning to only use your device with a single profile, it would be best to install Play Services within the Owner profile's private space.<R reference='58' /><R reference='109' />

I'd recommend installing Play Services in the Owner profile with background services disabled but authenticated with a Google account (it's possible to create one anonymously). The Owner profile will only serve to download and install apps (without Network permission, and apps immediately disabled after the download) which can then be installed into other profiles via the user management UI. This way you can have a secondary user profile within which Play Services are installed with 'Unrestricted' background usage, but without being authenticated to a specific Google account. Into this profile, you can install the messengers and social media apps that require FCM for reliable notifications.<R reference='232' />

**Android Auto**

If you've connected your Android phone with your car before, you're probably familiar with Android Auto. Originally, it requires privileged access but Graphene's sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer makes it work with a reduced level of privileges.<R reference='151' /> You can install and use the official releases of Android Auto<R reference='278' />, but it must be installed through the GrapheneOS App store.<R reference='11' /><R reference='41' /> On the other hand, for apps like [Waze](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en) to be available through Android Auto they must be installed from the official Google Play Store.<R reference='37' />

After installation, you have to open *Settings &raquo; Apps &raquo; Sandboxed Google Play &raquo; Android Auto*, and at least enable *'Allow permissions for wired Android Auto'*. If you can't get it working with this toggle alone, you may need to grant it wireless permissions too. Additional permissions for rerouting audio, phone calls, and notifications to Android Auto can be granted at your own judgment.<R reference='278' /> Note that Android Auto currently does not function from within a private space or work profile.<R reference='118' />

#### Obtainium & App Verifier

In Android, the package files downloaded to install or update an application are cryptographically signed. Once an app has been installed, the signer of the installation package is 'pinned' such that all future packages attempting to update it must have a signature of the same signer. This principle is called Trust-On-First-Use (TOFU) and it ensures that future updates of an application cannot come from malicious sources.<R reference='190' />

But this still does not guarantee that the package that you used for the first installation of the application actually came from the source you thought it does. Here, app stores play a useful role in establishing who the real signer of an app should be, basically by pinning the signer through the app store's metadata before even downloading the application's package.<R reference='164' /> On the other hand, an app store adds another third party that you have to trust, and this is where Obtainium can be used as a mitigation.<R reference='14' />

[Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) allows you to get Android apps, and keep them updated, straight from the source - ie. straight from their GitHub releases page.<R reference='22' /> By combining it with [AppVerifier](https://github.com/soupslurpr/AppVerifier) you can still ensure that the package file you're about to install truly comes from the real developer of the application. This makes managing you apps more decentralized without sacrificing an important security feature that app stores offer. Though the GrapheneOS project argues that the most decentralized solution would be replacing Obtainium with self-updating apps.<R reference='162' /><R reference='163' /><R reference='190' />

<ScreenshotCards num={2}>
  <ScreenshotCard
    description="Screenshot: Within Obtainium we can search for app packages from various sources such as GitHub and GitLab. After downloading them, Obtainium will prompt us to share the package with AppVerifier before continuing with the actual installation. Note that, before installing Obtainium itself, you can first download its package and verify it with AppVerifier, which you can get from Accrescent.">

#### Accrescent

[Accrescent](https://accrescent.app/) is an app store with a security-first mindset led by a contributor to the GrapheneOS project. It's available on the GrapheneOS App Store, although Accrescent is still in the early stages of development and so far only contains a small selection of applications. The GrapheneOS project intends to delegate securely hosting a wide array of third-party applications, both closed- and open-source, to Accrescent while the operating system's own app repository will only provide first-party applications and possibly a small number of lightly modified and hardened forks of useful third-party apps.<R reference='14' /><R reference='84' /><R reference='303' />

While the hope is that Accrescent will be one of the best ways to obtain apps on GrapheneOS going forward, it still lacks funding and contributors to substantially expand. The GrapheneOS project is actively supporting this in a move to replace F-Droid, which they have called out many times for their problematic security stance.<R reference='22' /><R reference='143' />

Accrescent appropriately secures the initial download and installation through its signed metadata without the need to use AppVerifier or to check the key fingerprint manually, although that's still possible to do after installation if desired.<R reference='190' />

#### F-Droid

[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) is well-known for being an exclusive repository for open-source Android applications. The GrapheneOS project has expressed very harsh criticism of F-Droid and does not recommend it as a secure source for third-party applications. The main reason is that F-Droid builds most of the apps directly from source on 'sketchy, outdated infrastructure', the resulting packages of which are then cryptographically signed by them, raising concern for a future mass-compromise of F-Droid users.<R reference='22' />

An advantage of app packages being signed by the developer is that it requires the signing key to be compromised for the attacker to be able to create a malicious package with a valid signature. This is arguably harder to achieve than introducing malicious changes to the source code on platforms like GitHub which F-Droid would then use to blindly build a signed package from. The GrapheneOS project argues that this greatly increases the risk of supply chain attacks.<R reference='190' />

Another problem stems from the fact that F-Droid self-signs app builds without ensuring that their build variant has a unique app id different from the one signed by the developers. Because the Trust-On-First-Use principle requires the signers of apps with the same id to match, this often causes confusion with users who try to reinstall an application within another profile or from a different source. Only the few applications that make use of F-Droid's reproducible build feature are excluded from this issue. For apps configured to use reproducible builds, F-Droid will discard their self-build package after verifying that it matches the developer-signed version. But at the moment it's not even possible to easily tell which apps are actually making use of this feature.<R reference='113' />

While F-Droid made an attempt to secure first-time installations through metadata signing, their approach turned out to be rather flawed.<R reference='303' /> There are more issues the GrapheneOS project notes in discussions on F-Droid, though not all of them are technical and therefore omitted here.<R reference='158' /><R reference='164' />

#### Play Store & Aurora Store

At the moment, the official Google Play Store app is still the most secure way to install closed-source apps, especially compared to using mirror sites like [APKPure](https://apkpure.com/apkpure-app.html) which basically have copies of all application packages of the Play Store - commonly used to bypass regional restrictions.<R reference='276' /> To reiterate, Google's Play Store and Services apps are treated like regular apps with no special privileges on GrapheneOS, whether you want to separate them into a secondary user profile is up to you.<R reference='52' /><R reference='53' />

The [Aurora Store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/) is an alternative client to the Google Store's app repository. It allows you to avoid installing the official Play Store app and offers using an anonymous Google account that you share with other Aurora users. The GrapheneOS project recommends against using Aurora due to its security being weaker and some apps being affected by Aurora as the app's source. Note that you can always create a non-identifiable account with a burner phone number in the official Play Store instead of using Aurora's rather unreliable anonymous account feature.<R reference='19' /><R reference='21' /><R reference='22' /><R reference='26'/><R reference='28' /><R reference='77' /><R reference='139' />

There's some criticism here on whether using so much of Google's applications, services and infrastructure doesn't defeat the purpose of using GrapheneOS. To this, the project clarifies that Graphene's purpose is not specifically avoiding Google, but providing a high level of privacy and security - even for those who do not want to make great sacrifices in terms of user experience. The ongoing work to provide a fully functional compatibility layer for Google's services is not a trivial feature but one that GrapheneOS is investing a lot of resources into. Either way, a fresh installation of GrapheneOS is completely de-Googled and whether you want to make use of the compatibility layer or avoid it, is completely up to you.<R reference='108' /><R reference='105' /><R reference='187' />

## Trouble and Shooting

#### Geo-Location Issues

Determining your location is another service originally provided as part of Google's Play Services. Instead, GrapheneOS by default re-routes location requests to the operating system<R reference='250' /><R reference='138' />, which exclusively uses the satellite location (GNSS) and therefore requires having satellite reception.<R reference='166' /> Due to this being unavailable or unreliable in situations where the sky is obscured, eg. by the concrete of a ceiling, there have been many complaints about location-based applications not working properly on GrapheneOS.<R reference='1' /><R reference='2' /><R reference='3' /><R reference='74' />

If you have a cellular carrier and Internet connection, the device should be able to use assisted satellite geolocation (A-GNSS) by requesting information on nearby cell towers (SUPL) and on things like the current orbits and status of satellites (PSDS). These make acquiring a lock on your location significantly faster. By default, GrapheneOS uses the project's own proxy servers to prevent associating your SUPL/PSDS requests with your IP address.<R reference='4' /><R reference='175' />

You can optionally turn on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning under *Settings &raquo; Location &raquo; Location services*. This will allow apps and services with the *'Nearby devices'* permission to scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth devices even while Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are turned off, potentially improving location-based features.<R reference='229' /> This information would typically be sent to Google's servers by Play Services to determine the location more accurately even inside buildings. The GrapheneOS project is in the process of creating its own implementation of this, likely first as a proxy to Apple's servers and later as its own database.<R reference='5' /><R reference='61' /><R reference='81' />

If you have sandboxed Play Services installed and want to use Google's network location service to provide improved location estimates, you first have to disable the *'Reroute location requests to the OS'* toggle at *Settings &raquo; Apps &raquo; Sandboxed Google Play*. Next, you'll have to change the Location permission of Play services to be set to *'Allow all the time'* as well as *'Use precise location'*. For it to be able to make use of network scanning, you also need to grant it the *'Nearby devices'* permission (the above-mentioned toggles for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning must already be enabled). Finally, you need to once again go to *Settings &raquo; Apps &raquo; Sandboxed Google Play* and tap on *'Google Location Accuracy'* and enable the *'Improve Location Accuracy'* toggle.<R reference='2' /><R reference='60' /><R reference='82' /><R reference='175' /><R reference='276' />

The re-routing toggle is not a global option, so you could consider setting up a secondary user profile for the sole purpose of making use of Google's privacy invasive location services for when you're having geo-location troubles.

#### Crashing/Broken Apps

We've already mentioned that it's not surprising for applications on GrapheneOS to crash or otherwise refuse to work properly, but this is nearly always fixable.<R reference='18' /> Before anything, you should first attempt standard steps such as clearing app cache, forcefully stopping and restarting the application, restarting the phone, or re-installing the application. Typical GrapheneOS-specific solutions include turning off some of the exploit protection measures, re-installing the application outside of a private space (Owner or other secondary profile), re-installing the app in a profile that provides sandboxed Google Play Services, etc.<R reference='8' /><R reference='12' /><R reference='39' /><R reference='208' /><R reference='218' /> Sometimes apps even start crashing because the application (eg. app store) from which they were installed from is no longer enabled or installed<R reference='241' />, or they refuse to work properly because they were not installed from the source that they expected.<R reference='19' />

#### App refuses to install

Typical reasons for this have also been explained above: You're attempting to install an application that is already available with a higher version or from a different source in another user profile.<R reference='36' />

#### Getting Support

GrapheneOS has a very active community and is responsive on social media. The easiest places to look for existing solutions for your problem are probably the forum at [discuss.grapheneos.org](https://discuss.grapheneos.org/) and their [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/grapheneos). GrapheneOS also has communities on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/i/communities/1530455827949273094), [Telegram](https://t.me/GrapheneOS), and [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/%23community:grapheneos.org).

You probably don't want one which only works when you're trying to log into a specific user and only deletes that user. You may want a form of it which only wipes specific secondary users, but that's different than having one that's specific to logging into a particular user. It's also worth noting that the duress PIN/password can be entered anywhere the PIN/password can be entered. If you enter it on PIN/password request for enabling developer options or changing certain settings, it's going to wipe the device in the same way as unlocking the device. We integrated it right after the check for the correct PIN/password in a universal way. We could extend it to working for SIM PIN entry too but we didn't do that in the initial implementation. It'd likely make sense to do it for SIM PIN entry but just wasn't in the initial phase. If for some strange reason you set the duress PIN/password and the real PIN/password to the same value it won't wipe the device since it checks for the real one first. We thought a lot about how to do it well and even behavior of having corrupt data you can't decrypt is intended. It wipes the hardware keystore keys which among other things prevents deriving any of the key encryption keys for encryption. Booting will initially fail because it can't derive key encryption keys. After trying again, it will give up and show the prompt to wipe and reformat. We plan to enhance it by also wiping a couple other things which also prevent deriving the key encryption keys. We don't want to actually reformat since that takes time and it's better to just shut down cleanly as soon as possible which wipes most memory via zero-on-free."*, https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1797325762036396169

Aurora Store is simply another frontend to the Play Store and doesn't fully work compared to sandboxed Google Play. Either way, you're installed packages from the Play Store and are trusting it. Aurora Store installs the wrong variant of apps by default due to not searching or fetching apps based on device model (anonymous mode). It logs into shared Google accounts by default which is problematic and gradually breaking, although you can make your own throwaway account. Many apps from the Play Store require the Play Store for Play Asset Delivery, Play Feature Delivery, app/content license checks, in-app payments and other Play Store features. This all works with the sandboxed Play Store. More and more Play Store apps depend on these things. Aurora Store doesn't verify Play Store signature metadata and doesn't use a reduced CA set or pinning like the Play Store itself. That means the downloads of apps with Aurora Store are only secured by HTTPS with every WebPKI CA trusted, which isn't very good.

There's a fork of it on Android called Molly which does implement keeping the database at rest. iOS makes it a bit easier than Android to keep data at rest while locked than Android, but yet there are better options for apps taking advantage of it on Android including 2FA apps and other things. It's not a lot of apps taking advantage of it and not super mainstream ones. Another example is that Android offers the Chromium layer-1 sandbox to every app as an isolatedProcess toggle for out-of-process services. It's easy to use. It's essentially not used in anything other than the OS and Chromium-based browsers. App developers do not do hardening... People might reasonably think Signal, etc. try to harden a lot against getting exploited via media, WebRTC, etc. and they'd be wrong. WebRTC in Signal is based on the Chromium implementation but doesn't sandbox it like Chromium does. At least they've gotten better at updating it. Trying to get app developers to opt-in to keeping data at rest when locked is never going to work out. Even if they'd done things the other way around and developers had to opt-in to not keeping it at rest when locked, most apps would probably just opt-in for all their data. The OS probably just needs to offer a per-app toggle for apps getting frozen while locked with all their data put at rest, which still won't benefit most users but at least people who are at risk can be told to use it and can enabled the feature for Signal, etc."*, https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1859406214746042771

This mostly matters in terms of long term support. Newer kernel versions have more attack surface but also better security features. Older branches aren't necessarily worse. However, older branches gradually get fewer patches backported and eventually have support dropped. Being on 6.6 instead of 6.1 isn't clearly more secure due to more attack surface, but being on 5.15 or 5.10 is starting to be clearly worse and they should be moved to 6.1 soon. 6th/7th gen Pixels provide nearly all those requirements.

  GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, July 30. *"https://x.com/arstechnica/status/1818325952553947517 The article unfortunately leaves out most of the points we made in the thread. GrapheneOS supports hardware-based attestation and it's entirely possible for Google to allow it as part of the Play Integrity API. They choose to ban using GrapheneOS. Play Integrity API has no minimum security patch level and nearly all these apps use weak software-based checks that are easily bypassed by attackers. The hardware-based checks rely on trusting every key distributed to every certified Android device, which are often leaked. Hardware-based attestation can be used for security purposes such as verifying device integrity with a pinning-based approach without the weakness of being vulnerable to leaked keys from the whole Android ecosystem since specific per-app keys in the secure element can be pinned. Play Integrity API is claimed to be based on devices complying with the Compatibility Test Suite and Compatibility Definition Document. We have irrefutable proof that the majority of certified Android devices do not comply with the CTS/CDD. Play Integrity API is based on lies. Essentially every non-Pixel device has important CTS failures not caused by CTS bugs. OEMs are cheating to obtain certification. Google claims GrapheneOS can't be permitted because we don't have a certification where they freely allow cheating and don't ban non-compliant devices. Since Play Integrity doesn't even have a minimum security patch level, it permits a device with multiple years of missing patches. Hardware attestation was required on all devices launched with Android 8 or later, but they don't enforce it to permit non-compliant devices. The reality is that the Play Integrity API permits devices from companies partnered with Google with privileged Google Play integration when they're running the stock OS. It's easy to bypass, but they'll make changes to block it being done at scale long term such as if we did it. It does not matter if these devices have years of missing security patches. It doesn't matter if the companies skipped or improperly implemented mandatory security features despite that being required by CDD compliance. Failing even very important CTS tests doesn't matter either. Google can either permit GrapheneOS in the Play Integrity API in the near future via the approach documented at https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide or we'll be taking legal action against them and their partners. We've started the process of talking to regulators and they're interested. We're not going to give Google veto power over what we're allowed to do in GrapheneOS. We comply with CTS and CDD except when it limits our ability to provide our users with privacy and security. Google wants to be in charge of which privacy/security features can be added. Nope. Google's behavior in the mobile space is highly anti-competitive. Google should be forbidden from including Google Mobile Services with privileged access unavailable to regular apps and services. GrapheneOS sandboxed Google Play proves that hardly anything even needs to change. Google should also be forbidden from participating in blocking using alternate hardware/firmware/software. They've abused their market position to reinforce their monopolies. They've used security as an excuse despite what they're doing having no relevance to it and REDUCING it. Google is forbidding people from using a growing number of apps and services on an objectively far more private and secure OS that's holding up much better against multiple commercial exploit developers: https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1815105015079416062. They're holding back security, not protecting it. We've put a lot of effort into collaborating with Google to improve privacy and security for all Android users. Their business team has repeatedly vetoed even considering giving us partner access. They rolled back us being granted security partner access by the security team. As with how they handle giving out partner access, the Play Integrity API serves the interests of Google's business model. They have no valid excuse for not allowing GrapheneOS to pass device and strong integrity. If app developers want to ban it, they can still do it themselves. After our security partner access was revoked, we stopped most of our work on improving Android security. We continued reporting vulnerabilities upstream. However, we're going to stop reporting most vulnerabilities until GrapheneOS is no longer blocked by the Play Integrity API. This year, we reported multiple serious vulnerabilities to Android used by widely used commercial exploit tools: https://source.android.com/docs/security/overview/acknowledgements. If Google wants more of that in the future, they can use hardware attestation to permit GrapheneOS for their device/strong integrity checks. Authy's response about their usage of the Play Integrity API shows their service is highly insecure and depends on having client side validation. Play Integrity is thoroughly insecure and easily bypassed, so it's unfortunate that according to Authy their security depends on it. If Authy insists on using it, they should use the standard Android hardware attestation API to permit using GrapheneOS too. It's easy to do: https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide. Banning 250k+ people with the most secure smartphones from using your app is anti-security, not pro-security. It's very unfortunate when new apps adopt the Play Integrity API and stop working. Authy isn't a very good choice for 2FA but many people use it and it's a problem for us for a widely used app to be incompatible. A single widely used app losing compatibility is a big deal to us."*, https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1818414579153596422

In order to make it easy to install sandboxed Google Play, our App Store provides mirrors of the official releases. These have through extensive testing by users either opting into the Alpha and Beta channels for those in our App Store along or Beta releases in the Play Store. Our compatibility layer teaches Play services and the Play Store how to function as regular apps via the standard Android APIs and permissions. It's not necessary to grant any permissions to either of them in order to use them and provide compatibility with near 100% of apps. Apps with mandatory or optional dependencies on Google Play are including Google Play libraries in their app. Many of these libraries such as Ads and Analytics work fine without Google Play services. These libraries could do everything sandboxed Google Play can do without it. For example, Google could include fallback code in the Firebase Cloud Messaging library to support receiving push messages through a service run by the app itself. Google could also support using Play services and Play Store as sandboxed apps. We've shown it works fine that way. It's important to understand that our approach is not granting any access to them or allowing them to do anything they couldn't do without it. Our compatibility layer demonstrates a regulator could reasonably require Google to not use capabilities unavailable to regular apps. Our approach also allows us to reimplement arbitrary portions of Google Play ourselves. For example, we reimplement the Play services location service by using the OS location service. By default, apps using Google Play location are redirected to standard GrapheneOS location. We provide emulated network location support to use apps depending on network location without it. We're in the process of implementing our own network location client with support for choosing between multiple services. It's currently being tested and polished up to ship it. Our opt-in network location that's going to be shipped soon is not tied to Google Play compatibility. It's available to any apps using the OS location API. Our default enabled redirection means that apps using Google Play location will transparently use this when it's enabled. We'll also be providing support for using Apple's location service or a GrapheneOS proxy to it as the starting point. We're also going to be providing our own location service based on our own database built from data scraped/merged from multiple sources which is entirely legal. Our own network location service will support downloading regional databases to use it entirely locally without sending location data to a service. We plan to provide the same features for the SUPL service used for A-GNSS which currently defaults to a GrapheneOS proxy to Google. We're also going to be providing our own implementation of geocoding (converting addresses to location) with a choice of providers which is currently in an experimental state. We can very easily host that ourselves too. We'll be doing the same for many other things over time. Our position is that useful features should be directly provided in the OS disconnected from Google Play compatibility. Apps using Google Play for it can be redirected to using the OS implementation instead with a toggle for it. We can also unify it with the provider toggles. For network-based location, it's completely legal for us to scrape enormous amounts of data from publicly available services not even requiring accounts to combine into our own multi-source database. It will allow us to provide non-satellite-dependent offline location detection. We have additional extensions beyond the baseline compatibility layer to support Android Auto. It's disabled by default, and Android Auto is a regular sandboxed app when installed. Users can choose to grant it extra USB access to use wired Android Auto.

PSDS is a database of predicted satellite locations and topographical data to speed up satellite locking locks. We host our own cache of the data on our servers. SUPL is kind of a network location lite requesting data on a carrier's cell towers to speed up GNSS which we proxy. [...] Apps can't scan for nearby cell towers or Wi-Fi networks without the Location permission. IoT devices with Wi-Fi can certainly detect their location via Wi-Fi scans. Look at https://wigle.net for an example. Apple and Google have much better databases. We don't like that network location is based on revealing location to a service, although if it's done with individual queries without a long live connection via a VPN that's much less of an issue. That's why we want local database support, requiring having our own database. Building our own db entirely with data we gather is unrealistic. It'd require having people submit huge amounts of privacy sensitive data. Our plan is to scrape the data from services like the Apple location service and merge it with data from BeaconDB (https://beacondb.net). The way this works in general is that you scan for nearby cell towers, Wi-Fi APs and Bluetooth devices which then get submitted to a service to get the locations of those things which can then be used to figure out location based on signal strength to each of them. Doing it with cell towers alone is already decent for a rough estimate. Wi-Fi is incredible for this in cities. This is how iOS and Android manage to provide indoor location without satellite receptions. They get nearly all users to not opt-out of it. People are used to it. [...] Wi-Fi APs should not be brought with you since their location can be found through tons of devices sending that data to Apple, Google, etc. If you move, bringing the same Wi-Fi router will give data showing someone moved from your old location to the new one. If your Wi-Fi AP simply stays in one location, that's not a privacy issue. Hiding the SSID doesn't change that there are packets marked as coming from and going to the MAC address for that AP. Hidden SSIDs also reduce client privacy and enable tracking. Each hidden AP hidden network you have saved on a laptop, phone, etc. is broadcast every time they scan for Wi-Fi networks. It allows tracking client devices despite MAC randomization. Should never save any hidden SSID networks. Hidden SSIDs only really reduce privacy."*, https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1855669762535075977

  GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, October 16. *"IMEI is not the only hardware identifier for the device available to the cellular network. Changing the IMEi alone isn't enough to hide the device identity from the network. It will only hide one commonly used ID rather than making the device not uniquely identifiable. Carriers often detect device model via IMEI and multiple other ways as part of their standard operating procedure. They change how things work based on the detected capabilities but also hard-wired quirks for device models, etc. Devices send a lot of info on capabilities. It's possible to detect the devices with an IMEI not matching their capabilities/configuration or to detect that there's a device with the IMEI changing repeatedly but the other device identifiers remaining the same. You could end up drawing attention to yourself by doing it... Similarly, using a very niche hardware device to connect to the network such as a standalone hotspot device stands out. Those devices are also far less secure than simply using a Pixel with GrapheneOS. They typically don't get proper updates and lack basic security measures. If you really want to have cellular done from a separate device, a used Pixel with GrapheneOS is a good option. If you want a fresh identity for the cellular network, there isn't really much alternative to using both a fresh device and SIM. Wi-Fi has a much more private design. To summarize: 1) IMEI randomization is a poor way to improve privacy and will draw attention to yourself in practice. 2) Dedicated Hotspot devices aren't good for privacy/security. 3) Use airplane mode + Wi-Fi with our default per-connection MAC randomization for better privacy. MAC randomization alone was not enough. Wi-Fi has had major privacy improvements on common devices like iPhones and Pixels in recent years to neuter other tracking based on sequence numbers, etc. We're aware of 1 remaining issue which has is reported/accepted as a vulnerability. Also, bear in mind that carrying around a Wi-Fi access point (AP) is the opposite of private. An AP has a persistent MAC even if it's random upon creating the AP such as making a hotspot with a phone. Wi-Fi does not have MAC rotation like Bluetooth Low Energy privacy extensions. GrapheneOS uses per-connection MAC rand and per-connection DHCP as improvements over the standard Android Open Source Project. The MAC still remains the same while connected, and an AP isn't going to cycle until it's reset. Wi-Fi does not try to do what BLE privacy extensions do. To clarify, an access point means a router such as Wi-Fi hotspot from a phone. If you enable Wi-Fi hotspot, it chooses a random MAC and uses it until it's disabled. Bluetooth LE tries to provide privacy for a paired device being carried around incl. MAC rotation. Wi-Fi does not. [...] The radio has hardware IDs so it's very clear that it's the same device using a new SIM. There is not much point cycling one without also cycling the other at the same time. [...] In general, you should only use the supported devices, which means Pixel 6 and later. 8th/9th generation Pixels have a much more hardened OS via hardware memory tagging. 9th generation Pixels currently have more cellular baseband hardening but it may get backported to 8th gen. We're not at all particularly recommending using a 2nd device for cellular though. We're just pointing out that using GrapheneOS on a used Pixel 6a would be much more secure for that purpose than using the dedicated hotspot devices. The hotspot devices are generally awful. [...] We've explained it in this thread: 1) There are more hardware identifiers than IMEI, IMSI and EID. Avoiding using eSIMs doesn't avoid having more hardware identifiers than IMEI. 2) Network sees what kind of radio/device it is and how it behaves, which impacts how it functions. To expand on the 2nd point, that means if you choose a completely random IMEI instead of a random choice among IMEIs of a similar type of device, it will clearly be a device that's using a random IMEI. By clearly having a random IMEI, that stands out a lot and invites attention. There are typically other hardware identifiers for the radio than IMEI and the eSIM ID. It is similar to how many Wi-Fi adapters largely used to leak other info and had silly things like info on the type of adapter or even a serial number included in each probe request. [...] They can uniquely identify the radio so with a non-KYC device and non-KYC SIM, you're essentially using a persistent pseudonym. If you randomize the IMEI and switch SIMs there are still other IDs and a fully random IMEI isn't going to match your hardware which is obvious. [...] IMEI and IMSI are the most common but there are several other common hardware identifiers including ones specific to a physical SIM and ones specific to an eSIM. It's more complex than Wi-Fi where MAC address randomization commonly doesn't actually work due to other IDs. Look into papers on MAC randomization not actually working. There's some nice research on it. iPhones and Pixels made adjustments to Wi-Fi with the Wi-Fi vendors to address this but our community has found some remaining minor weaknesses which have been reported to get fixed. Cellular is far more of a mess than Wi-Fi where minimal probe information, probe sequence number randomization and a few other things combined with MAC randomization and higher level OS changes should be enough. Cellular is designed to identity the device so it's much different. In the past, Wi-Fi hardware, firmware and drivers were not carefully designed and implementation to avoid identifying the hardware to the network. This has been largely addressed for iPhones and Pixels, and it's trickling down to other smartphones. Laptops are more behind though. Cellular is a completely different story. It has a bunch of explicit device identifiers but also other ways it identifies itself to the network. There's also often persistent state for the radio which can do the same thing rather than it just being completely fresh each boot. There isn't comparable research into cellular privacy partly because of a mix of perceived and real regulatory and legal issues. People believe the issue is that changing the IMEI is illegal, but it's often legal. The real issue is that it leaks device identity despite that... Changing the main IMEI that's provided also doesn't mean that the original IMEI isn't available via diagnostic messages, but there are other identifiers. There's also often persistent radio state usable for tracking it regardless of the device identifiers. It's not very private. eSIM ID is a well documented identifier but there are more than those. Even aside from all the actual identifiers, there are other ways of tracking similar to how MAC randomization is not enough for Wi-Fi even if it's the only identifier, but cellular has more than 1 identifier. [...] There are more cellular radio identifiers than IMEI. People should really be aware that they are not truly preventing uniquely identifying the device through changing the IMEI. Randomizing IMEI is easily detected and clearly stands out from other devices too. Cellular network can see what kind of radio is connecting and what capabilities there are along with there usually being some persistent state for the radio rather than each boot being an entirely fresh start. There are also other IDs. It's just not designed to avoid tracking. It's not specific to smartphones or particular kinds of radios, it's cellular in general. Wi-Fi had awful privacy even with MAC randomization and often had other things like a serial number included in probe requests, etc. but there was research into it and problems got solved. Wi-Fi is still not perfect but at least on iPhones and Pixels it's a lot better than it was. We're aware of 1 minor issue with the Broadcom Wi-Fi radio on Pixels which only applies when connected to a network, not scanning. It has been reported and acknowledged as a security bug. [...] We're talking about there being other hardware identifiers or even the original IMEI still being shared based on research done by our community and others including with mobile hotspot devices. It is similar to Wi-Fi MAC rand before efforts to get rid of other leaked identifiers. You know there's an official eSIM ID (EID) for the eSIM secure element, right? That's a clearly documented non-IMEI hardware identifier. We're also talking about using a physical SIM though, not only eSIM. See https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10402530. We're talking about more than that though. We cannot share the very minor Wi-Fi privacy issue disclosed to us because a firmware/driver patch is not available yet, but other Wi-Fi adapters often have far bigger issues and it's a good thing that the remaining privacy issues with regular Wi-Fi usage have become so minor. The standard Broadcom Wi-Fi adapters on Nexus and other devices used to have firmware from Broadcom adding a whole bunch of unnecessary info to probe requests and other Wi-Fi packets. They also used a sequential probe sequence number and other counters. until fully reset. Some Wi-Fi adapters literally sent off a serial number not just MAC, defeating MAC randomization. Essentially all would end up having a quite unique probe sequence number after being used for a while with a predictable rate of increase. These issues were solved for Pixels and should have trickled down to other Android devices now, although we haven't looked at how it currently works elsewhere. One relatively minor non-scanning issue is known and they should be working on it and fixing it in a few months. [...] '> I saw you recommended turning the phone off, that also doesn't prevent tracking. Powered off in a faraday bag, maybe.' Airplane mode and turning off the device work fine in practice if it doesn't have a special offline tracking system such as Apple's optional Find My network. Regulations essentially require both of those to work properly but are poorly enforced. Devices can make mistakes and have issues like airplane mode not being active in early boot. It's unlikely for it to be improperly implemented on something like an iPhone though."*, https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1846709900715458703

Changes to signing keys must be authorized with key rotation proofs. They implemented it as sharing the installed packages to save storage, memory (smaller page cache) and bandwidth. It's just something to bear in mind. The main way this comes up is because not all app developers follow best practices. You're supposed to have a unique app id for each variant of app, including different types of builds or builds signed with different keys. Some devs reuse ids. F-Droid is the main offender. They reuse the app ids used by developers for their standalone and/or Play Store releases for nearly every single app in F-Droid despite nearly all being signed with F-Droid keys.

[...] 10 years ago was 2014, the year we started our project, and there was good baseband isolation on Snapdragon. There was not generally proper IOMMU isolation for other components not included in the SoC. Qualcomm handled it well, but Android OEMs and other hardware vendors didn't. Since then, Android phone security has massively improved and proper isolation for most hardware components is the norm now. Laptop and desktop firmware/hardware security hasn't improved much and is increasingly far behind, but IOMMU isolation is slowly getting fixed there."*, https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1846372770692976760

Sharing Google accounts for the Play Store is also a potential security concern, but we haven't investigated what can be done with an account for the Play Store particularly via enterprise policy, etc. Not verifying signatures has much clearer security consequences though.

It has a horrible set of component choices for security, doesn't get basic firmware updates and is missing very basic security features. It's the opposite of a secure device. You were also hardly endorsing Purism there but rather talking about it as someone interested in the topic. Purism has been heavily promoting their products with highly misleading and outright false claims for many years, and it's understandable people get misled by marketing. We have no interest at all in working with Purism or supporting their hardware. We're very interested in working with an OEM to make hardware to run GrapheneOS but there's absolutely no chance we work with them. They're anti-security and the false marketing causes serious harm. Yes, and they don't ship important firmware and microcode updates because of it. They also go out of the way to sabotage it by preventing updating important parts of the firmware from the OS, which instead has to be manually flashed with JTAG cables, etc. as if users will do it. They say update the firmware on their devices before shipping them, but then they don't get updates anymore. They essentially acknowledge that it's critical to security but then go out of the way to avoid it. This is the purpose and design of their products, not a side thing. Nearly the entire purpose of Purism products is avoiding updating the proprietary firmware from the OS. When they describe their hardware as open and freedom respecting, what they actually mean is the nearly entirely proprietary hardware/firmware works without the OS updating it. They make component choices largely based on using components which store firmware on their own flash storage and don't require the OS to load it. This is generally a bad security practice and it's no surprise that it leads to them choosing much less secure, sketchy components. [...] They not only avoid updating firmware/microcode, choose insecure components where they don't have to load it from the OS and block updating it but they even remove warnings in the Linux kernel and other software about out-of-date firmware and information on how to update it. Yes, that's what it does. The microcode/firmware is nearly entirely in the separate linux-firmware project. The vast majority of what they're doing is stripping out portions of the ability to update firmware/microcode and removing warnings about it. See https://phoronix.com/news/GNU-Linux-Libre-4.16-Released. This is also largely what the distributions based on the same ideology are doing. They don't only have an issue with shipping non-open-source software and in practice their main issue is actually with updating firmware/microcode that's going to be present regardless. They don't only have an issue with shipping the updates for it but even enabling people to obtain them and informing them about their device being insecure. They're actively covering up vulnerabilities to the point they're scrubbing it from log messages most people won't see. [...] They remove these kinds of warnings because they view it as promoting updating the firmware which is what they're against and the entire purpose of the project. They actively cover up security vulnerabilities and actively mislead people about it. It's ideological, that's all. They follow a religion based around software licensing, which tells them that closed source hardware and closed source firmware are out of scope as long as the firmware can't be updated. To them, a Wi-Fi SoC with no onboard firmware is bad. One with hard-wired firmware is good. They prefer hardware with the ability to update the firmware somehow disabled or broken, which they consider to be making it freedom respecting since the ability to update the closed source firmware is gone so they consider it to be hardware and out of scope for free software. It's standard FSF ideology. They could have taken the more logical approach considering open source hardware, firmware and software all important instead of only software. Instead, they came up with contrived justifications for why closed software is crucial but those aren't. Purism is catering to this ideology as their market niche. They attract true believers in it to work there too. They view this as a crucial ideological battle and therefore as with many political activists are fine with things like blatantly lying in order to advance their goals."*, https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1846323143285076435

Google Play is a core part of those OSes and always has access to these things but does have a toggle for this service.

Qualcomm's approach isn't inherently less secure though. Any device with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth has a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth baseband. It's often a unified chip because they're very similar protocols and need a similar baseband chip / RTOS so it might as well be reused. Decent ones will have internal hardening included sandboxed processes. Bluetooth accessories have one too, not only devices supporting using them. Bluetooth accessories are usually quite bad at protecting against attacks and tend to be way behind on adopting current generation Bluetooth privacy/security or simply getting firmware patches. What's the logic for being very concerned about a cellular radio but not a Wi-Fi radio? They're isolated in the same way, or in the case of laptops/desktops often not really isolated at all right now. In many cases it's even same company making both and the same baseband/RTOS. Since there are 3 separate chips for cellular, Wi-Fi/BT and GNSS on the phones we support, it's technically possible to remove cellular and the phone will still function without it since they're built to be robust to partial hardware failures. Samsung builds both the main SoC and the cellular radio, so what would you gain by removing the cellular radio instead of using airplane mode? It's not very logical to believe Samsung is putting backdoors into an isolated radio rather than the more privileged main SoC."*, https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1837596458561741073

  GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, September 9. *"We don't recommend F-Droid or Aurora Store. We recommend getting apps from the Accrescent app store for the ones already available. Using Obtainium to get apps directly from developers is far from perfect but is less bad than trusting F-Droid as a third party building/signing. Aurora Store isn't a very secure way to get apps from the Play Store. For that purpose, we recommend the sandboxed Play Store feature supported by GrapheneOS for most use cases. APKs from the Play Store are mostly generated/signed by the Play Store and many contain Google Play. Since many of those apps contain Google Play SDK / libraries anyway, you're running Google Play code in the app sandbox by using apps from there anyway. Some of the Google Play libraries don't work without Play services but many including Ads and Analytics work without it. F-Droid can be used as a stopgap if you prefer it over getting apps from developers directly, but we strongly recommend considering migrating away from F-Droid in the long term. Aurora Store is an option, but has problems and isn't usually what we recommend for most people. [...] No, every APK has a whole file signature using a much more modern approach than PGP. Android's package manager verifies the signature of every installed APK. It enforces future updates being signed with the same key or a key authorized by it and disallows a lower versionCode. It's possible to verify key fingerprint to confirm it matches the official developer signing keys. AppVerifier supports doing this automatically for the database of key fingerprints it has included in the app. It also supports manually checking with a provided key fingerprint. F-Droid obtains the source code to build and sign the apps from where it's published on GitHub or elsewhere. If that's compromised, they'll build and sign compromised code. They don't do even cursory review and even if they did would not be a viable way to find hidden attacks. F-Droid signs nearly all the apps themselves, meaning they're another trusted party. You trust the developer, the platform where they downloaded the sources and F-Droid themselves compared to trusting the developer's own signed releases. Accrescent is better than that though. Accrescent publishes the developer signed releases but it has signed metadata itself so it secures the initial download/install without users having to use AppVerifier to check the key fingerprint themselves. You can still do that after installing if you want though. F-Droid greatly increases the risk of a supply chain attack. They do not review/audit the code they're packaging. They run trivial automated scans which attackers are aware of and can run themselves. It is highly unlikely to detect anything regardless. It's more attack surface. F-Droid adds the F-Droid developers along with their poorly maintained infrastructure and build environment as attack surface for all the apps you install from it. Getting one app from it is definitely not as risky as getting as much as you can from it since apps are sandboxed. F-Droid doesn't uphold basic security features and the security model for app sources. It doesn't keep up with current era security protections.

Non-Google apps can use it via the standard AOSP APIs which weren't very capable but are being overhauled to provide LLM model acceleration instead of a lower level, hard to use neural net acceleration API. Certain Google apps know how to directly use the TPU on Pixels acceleration for local AI hardware acceleration, so Pixels have more of these features than elsewhere. Pixel Camera and Google Photos are the major examples, but other Google apps use it. It's a toggle on GrapheneOS. Since it doesn't have any direct privacy impact due to not giving any additional access to data, our toggle for Google apps using the TPU is enabled by default. It exists in case someone wants to reduce attack surface. In theory, there could be a GPU acceleration toggle too. [...] Settings > Apps > Special App Access > Special access to hardware accelerators for Google apps. It's a single toggle rather than a per-app toggle because only specific Google apps know how to use the TPU. Our toggle allows that list of specific Google apps to use the Pixel TPU."*, https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1823468140111548667

Samsung is increasingly behind both but much better than Windows or desktop Linux. Samsung was a leader in Android security features but never had a very holistic approach and fell way behind. Pixels have heavily benefited from being very open to security research. They've ended up receiving by far the most external security research attention. Apple puts up lots of barriers to research but it doesn't slow down sophisticated attackers and is a negative, not positive. Samsung is still doing a lot better than non-Pixel Android devices but that's about it. They shipped a lot of security features first but they didn't maintain that lead.

(By code I'm referring to Dalvik bytecode, but there's no need to get too technical.) AOSP makes the distinction between cold/hot code ("hot" = often used compared to "cold") and uses AOT/JIT depending on the situation, whereas GrapheneOS chooses to use ART AOT all the way.

  GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, November 27. *"Our 2024111700 release overhauled the way sandboxed Google Play runs background services. Our GmsCompat app runs a foreground service and used to keep a connection open to Play services and Play Store. It now creates the connection on-demand when they need a foreground service. Toggling off background data usage for Play services and Play Store will now stop their background services being able to use data. That now blocks it from using mobile data when it's not running a foreground service since another foreground service isn't always using it anymore. Some users previously blocked background data usage for them and now they don't have FCM and other features working anymore. Similarly, some users never granted it Unrestricted battery usage which was required for FCM to work reliably but is now even more required than before. Apps can be set to one of 3 different battery modes: Restricted, Optimized (Default) and Unrestricted. Optimized heavily restricts the app running in the background based on how much it's used. Restricted nearly fully prevents apps running in the background on their own. Android 14 QPR2 changed this from a menu with the 3 options to a toggle for Restricted being on or off. The text next to the toggle is a button to open an inner menu with Optimized vs. Unrestricted. Users find this confusing and we're considering changing it back to how it was. Our sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer makes a notification requesting Unrestricted battery usage for Play services with a permission request dialog. The issue is that if users miss this or dismiss it, it's trickier than before to find the setting to enable it manually. We also show this as a detected issue in Settings > Apps > Sandboxed Google Play in the suggestions in shows. The issue is that some users may want the background usage heavily restricted for sandboxed Play services. We don't want to nag people who actually want it very limited. Our compatibility layer already shows a notification about this until users either grant Unrestricted battery mode for sandboxed Play services or press "Don't show again" to dismiss the notification permanently. It will show again if it's only dismissed without pressing that. It seems this isn't quite enough because we see a steady stream of people not granting Unrestricted battery mode and not realizing it's why their push notifications are delayed. It's valid to not grant it to it. It runs fine without it granted but it means push, etc. won't work. [...] Allow background usage toggle is not the same thing as the Unrestricted but rather Unrestricted is in the inner menu. Our compatibility layer requests it repeatedly after the initial install of Google Play unless you use "Don't show again". Only need to do it manually if you did. Google Services Framework (GSF) is treated as part of Play services (like other shared uid apps) and doesn't have fully separate permissions. Fresh installs of sandboxed Google Play no longer install GSF anymore but it shouldn't be removed for an existing install of it."*, https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1861659810036404316

I wouldn't recommend it. You should be up-to-date, and keep in mind that you can control which type of network the updater uses to update.

So I'd prefer an option to delay it by 24-48 hours so that I can manually start the update later when I might have more battery or have a charger accessible. [...] Another good reason is that while updates do bring along security improvements, they also bring along the possibility of introducing unexpected bugs or even complete system failure. Consequently, as a matter of having a perfectly functional device, it is important to delay updates until a point when you have time to devote to dealing with unexpected problems.

And as you said, you don't need a third-party app to enable and manage the feature. [...] By their very nature, user profiles provide totally different workspaces and GrapheneOS provides the option to put the entire profile at rest with an "End session" button.

VoWi-Fi could theoretically go through another VPN but it would need to support sending IPSec traffic through it which is not usually the case. You can't trivially send IPSec through another VPN.

  GrapheneOS Website, Features overview, 2024, November 28. *"The first line of defense is attack surface reduction. Removing unnecessary code or exposed attack surface eliminates many vulnerabilities completely. [...] The next line of defense is preventing an attacker from exploiting a vulnerability, either by making it impossible, unreliable or at least meaningfully harder to develop. [...] there's often a high performance, memory or compatibility cost to deploying them. [...] thus we offer toggles for users to choose the compromises they prefer instead of forcing it on them. [...] The final line of defense is containment through sandboxing at various levels: fine-grained sandboxes around a specific context like per site browser renderers, sandboxes around a specific component like Android's media codec sandbox and app/workspace sandboxes like the Android app sandbox used to sandbox each app which is also the basis for user/work profiles. [...] Remote code execution vulnerabilities are the most serious and allow an attacker to gain a foothold on the device or even substantial control over it remotely. Local code execution vulnerabilities allow breaking out of a sandbox including the app sandbox or browser renderer sandbox after either compromising an app/browser renderer remotely, compromising an app's supply chain or getting the user to install a malicious app. [...] Attack surface reduction: Greatly reduced remote, local and proximity-based attack surface by stripping out unnecessary code, making more features optional and disabling optional features by default (NFC, Bluetooth, UWB, etc.), when the screen is locked (USB, USB-C, pogo pins, camera access) and optionally after a timeout (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi)."*, https://grapheneos.org/features

Apps installed in the Owner profile are sandboxed the same way as everywhere else and don't receive any special access. If you want to choose which apps use Google Play rather than making it available to all of them, install it in a separate user or work profile for apps depending on Google Play. You could also do it the other way around, but it makes more sense to try to use as much as possible without Google Play rather than treating not using it as the exceptional case. [...] Signing in into a Google account is optional, unless you want to use features depending on being signed into an account. For example, some apps use Google account authentication instead of their accounts having a username and password. The Play Store requires being signed into an account in order to install apps or use in-app purchases. [...] The Play Store provides many services used by apps including Play Asset Delivery, Play Feature Delivery, in-app purchases and license checks for paid apps. The Play Store app is also the most secure way to install and update apps from the Play Store. Our compatibility layer has support for Play Games Services which you can obtain by installing Google Play Games from the Play Store. Many games on the Play Store depend on having Google Play Games installed. [...] The compatibility layer has a configuration menu available at Settings > Apps > Sandboxed Google Play. By default, apps using Google Play geolocation are redirected to our own implementation on top of the standard OS geolocation service. You don't need to grant any permissions to Google Play or change any settings for working location in apps using Google Play geolocation due to our rerouting feature. If you want to use Google's network location service to provide location estimates without satellite reception, you can disable the "Reroute location requests to OS APIs" toggle and grant what it requires to provide network location. You will need to grant "Allow all the time" Location access to Google Play services along with the Nearby Devices permission for it to have all the access it needs. You need to use the "Google Location Accuracy" link from the sandboxed Google Play configuration menu to access the Google Play services menu for opting into their network location service, otherwise this is all pointless. It will send the nearby Wi-Fi and cellular networks provided via the Location and Nearby Devices permissions to their service to retrieve a location estimate. In order to fully take advantage of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, you also need to enable the scanning toggles in Settings > Location  > Location services which are disabled by default and control whether apps with the required permissions can scan when Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are otherwise disabled. Re-routing location to the OS geolocation service will use more power than using the Google Play geolocation service since we do not provide a network-based location service and implement it via GNSS / A-GPS only.

  GrapheneOS Website, Frequently Asked Questions, 2024, November 28. *"Disk Encryption: Sensitive data is stored in user profiles. User profiles each have their own unique, randomly generated disk encryption key and their own unique key encryption key is used to encrypt it. The owner profile is special and is used to store sensitive system-wide operating system data. This is why the owner profile needs to be logged in after a reboot before other user profiles can be used. The owner profile does not have access to the data in other profiles. [...] GrapheneOS enables support for ending secondary user profile sessions after logging into them. It adds an end session button to the lockscreen and in the global action menu accessed by holding the power button. This fully purges the encryption keys and puts the profiles back at rest. This can't be done for the owner profile without rebooting due to it encrypting the sensitive system-wide operating system data. Using a secondary profile for regular usage allows you to make use of the device without decrypting the data in your regular usage profile. It also allows putting it at rest without rebooting the device. Even if you use the same passphrase for multiple profiles, each of those profiles still ends up with a unique key encryption key and a compromise of the OS while one of them is active won't leak the passphrase. The advantage to using separate passphrases is in case an attacker records you entering it. [...] In order to retrieve the Weaver token, the secure element requires the correct Weaver key. A secure internal timer is used to implement hardware-based delays for each attempt at key derivation. It quickly ramps up to 1 day delays before the next attempt. [...] The password token, Weaver token and other values like the OS verified boot key are used by the TEE as inputs to a hardware-bound key derivation algorithm provided by the SoC."*, https://grapheneos.org/faq

  GrapheneOS Website, Frequently Asked Questions, 2024, November 28. *"Cellular tracking, interception and silent SMS: GrapheneOS always considers networks to be hostile and avoids placing trust in them. [...] Cellular networks use inherently insecure protocols and have many trusted parties. Even if interception of the connection or some other man-in-the-middle attack along the network is not currently occurring, the network is still untrustworthy and information should not be sent unencrypted. Authenticated transport encryption such as HTTPS for web sites avoids trusting the cellular network. End-to-end encrypted protocols such as the Signal messaging protocol also avoid trusting the servers. [...] Connecting to your carrier's network inherently depends on you identifying yourself to it and anyone able to obtain administrative access. Activating airplane mode will fully disable the cellular radio transmit and receive capabilities, which will prevent your phone from being reached from the cellular network and stop your carrier (and anyone impersonating them to you) from tracking the device via the cellular radio. The baseband implements other functionality such as Wi-Fi and GPS functionality, but each of these components is separately sandboxed on the baseband and independent of each other. Enabling airplane mode disables the cellular radio, but Wi-Fi can be re-enabled and used without activating the cellular radio again. This allows using the device as a Wi-Fi only device. Receiving a silent SMS is not a good indicator of being targeted by your cell carrier, police or government because anyone on the cell network can send them including yourself. Cellular triangulation will happen regardless of whether or not SMS texts are being sent or received by the phone. Even if an SMS did serve a useful purpose for tracking, a silent SMS would be little different than receiving unsolicited spam. In fact, sending spam would be stealthier since it wouldn't trigger alerts for silent SMS but rather would be ignored with the rest of the spam. Regardless, sending texts or other data is not required or particularly useful to track devices connected to a network for an adversary with the appropriate access. Airplane mode is the only way to avoid the cellular network tracking your device and works correctly on the devices we support."*, https://grapheneos.org/faq

  GrapheneOS Website, Frequently Asked Questions, 2024, November 28. *"When you have both a cellular connection and Location enabled, control plane and/or user plane (SUPL) A-GNSS is used in addition to PSDS to greatly reduce the time needed for GNSS to obtain an initial location lock. These obtain coarse location info from a server based on nearby cell towers. Control plane A-GNSS is provided by the cellular connection itself and therefore doesn't have any real privacy implications while SUPL connects to a server often not provided by the carrier. Most A-GNSS services only accelerate obtaining a satellite-based location and won't provide an estimate on their own. The carrier can choose a SUPL server as part of their carrier configuration but most leave it at the default of supl.google.com. By default, GrapheneOS overrides the carrier/fallback SUPL server and uses the supl.grapheneos.org proxy. [...] GrapheneOS also disables sending IMSI and phone number as part of SUPL."*, https://grapheneos.org/faq

[...] A VPN provides a network layered on top of the underlying networks and the OS uses the VPN-provided DNS servers for everything beyond resolving the IP address of the VPN and performing network connectivity checks on each of the underlying networks in addition to the VPN itself.

  GrapheneOS Website, Frequently Asked Questions, 2024, November 28. *"Notifications: [...] they rely on receiving events through Google servers via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) in the background and sometimes even in the foreground, although it doesn't have good reliability/latency. [...] In order to properly implement either push messaging or frequent polling themselves, an app needs to run a foreground service. This is displayed as a persistent notification. It will normally be marked as a silent notification with the lowest possible default importance for a foreground service (IMPORTANCE_LOW). It can be reduced to the lowest importance (IMPORTANCE_MIN) by the user if they set the notification channel to be collapsed which will collapse it in the notification tray and it won't show up as an icon in the status bar or on the lockscreen anymore. Users can also disable the notification and the foreground service will continue working. A battery optimization exception is also needed for the app to bypass device idle states and run while the device is idle. If you can tolerate delays while the device is idle, then the battery optimization exception isn't mandatory."*, https://grapheneos.org/faq

By default, an Android app can only access a limited range of system resources. The system manages Android app access to resources that, if used incorrectly or maliciously, could adversely impact the user experience, the network, or data on the device. These restrictions are implemented in a variety of different forms. Some capabilities are restricted by an intentional lack of APIs to the sensitive functionality (for example, there is no Android API for directly manipulating the SIM card). In some instances, separation of roles provides a security measure, as with the per-app isolation of storage. In other instances, the sensitive APIs are intended for use by trusted apps and protected through a security mechanism known as Permissions."*, https://source.android.com/docs/security/overview/app-security

  @GrapheneOS@grapheneos.social, 2024, July 20. *"GrapheneOS App Store now includes a mirror of Accrescent, which is a privacy and security focused alternative to the Play Store distributing developer builds of apps: https://accrescent.app/ Accrescent comes from within the GrapheneOS community and we're collaborating together. Accrescent is in alpha and isn't yet open to any developers uploading their apps. It will have a lot more apps available in the future. It will become a full alternative to Play Store permitting closed source apps too, but you'll be able to filter to show only open source apps. Lead dev of Accrescent is a GrapheneOS user and contributor. It'll be a good place to publish apps for GrapheneOS users. AppVerifier, BeauTyXT and Transcribro are from the same person who wrote our Info app. Molly is a security-focused fork of Signal from another GrapheneOS user. AppVerifier was based on a planned GrapheneOS feature for users to verify APK files based on their key fingerprint. The feature is currently stalled since relying on the clipboard isn't ideal. For now, users can use AppVerifier from Accrescent until we ship a built-in approach. We'll be delegating distributing developer builds of apps signed by the developers to Accrescent rather than doing it in ourselves. Our App Store will be focused on our own apps and eventually hardened, rebranded builds of important third party apps widely used by our community. [...] We can't recommend using F-Droid due to extremely poor security practices throughout their client, repository design and infrastructure. The developers have an anti-security attitude and have demonstrated thoroughly untrustworthy behavior. We're going to be supporting Accrescent and helping them get what they need to reach a stable release and provide a huge number of apps with the support of the app developers. People are free to use F-Droid on GrapheneOS but we won't promote it. [...] F-Droid attempts to do repository metadata signing but both the approach they take and implementation is quite flawed. Transport security via HTTPS using WebPKI doesn't only trust their server. It also trusts every CA and sub-CA without a way to monitor abuse since unlike a browser there isn't enforced Certificate Transparency. We pin root keys and backup keys for our services in our apps but of course it's not what's relied on for verifying App Store repository metadata. [...] It does protect against an attacker who has compromised both the server for the app store and has obtained the developer's signing key. They would need to put a backdoor into a release, which they could do whether or not it's open source software and whether or not it's built by the app store. F-Droid pretends building apps offers protection against this but the reality is that they blindly build the code and there is no way to auto-detect backdoors being added. [...] The app's signing key is how the OS package manager verifies the app, but both our App Store and Accrescent also verify each downloaded APK based on the repository metadata. We were explaining that having control of the app repository and the developer's signing key isn't enough because the repository metadata is signed offline. That's why we said they'd need to actually put a backdoor into either the app's source code or the latest official build of the app. Reproducible build verification can't actually prevent this. It only prevents them putting it into the build without also putting it into the source code. It's clearly possible to put a backdoor into the source code without it being detected as shown by the multiple times it has been caught happening after the fact in widely used projects. The most well known recent example was the xz ssh backdoor, but that's not the only one, and there may be important missed cases."*, https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/112821386750410102
