```

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Tx is dangerous because it includes a `delegatecall` to contract `0x96221423681a6d52e184d440a8efcebb105c7242`.</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Tx is dangerous because it includes a `delegatecall` that transfers a `0` token amount to address `0xbdd077f651ebe7f7b3ce16fe5f2b025be2969516`.</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Tx is safe because it initiates a `call` to the `0xa9059cbb` router selector allowing it to execute a multi-token swap.</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Not enough data is provided to analyze this transaction.</li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A, B.**

In this question we are solely given the Solidity function selector (MethodID) and the calldata that is being passed to that function. We lack any further information on the transaction such as the address of the contract being called.

Based on the given bytes signature `0x6a761202` we are however able to determine possible methods in question via services such as [4byte.directory](https://www.4byte.directory/signatures/?bytes4_signature=0x6a761202), which tells us that a known text signature is the following:

```javascript
execTransaction(address,uint256,bytes,uint8,uint256,uint256,uint256,address,address,bytes)
```

Recognizing this as the `execTransaction` method for executing a transaction with Gnosis Safe requires some familiarity with it - or some Internet research skills. Either way, we're able to determine that the parameter of type `uint8` controls the `operation` used. If `operation` is set to `0`, Gnosis Safe will execute a normal `call`, if set to `1`, it will be a `delegatecall`.

Option A is indeed true as we can see that the `operation` parameter has been set to `delegatecall` in the given transaction:

```yaml
[3]:  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

And the target of the `delegatecall` operation is indeed `0x96221423681a6d52e184d440a8efcebb105c7242` as specified by the first parameter (`address to`) within the given calldata:

```yaml
[0]:  00000000000000000000000096221423681a6d52e184d440a8efcebb105c7242
```

The calldata passed to this address specifies that the method is `0xa9059cbb`, which, after looking it up, you should be familiar with as `transfer(address,uint256)` - a method typical for an ERC-20 token transfer.

```yaml
[11]: a9059cbb000000000000000000000000bdd077f651ebe7f7b3ce16fe5f2b025b
[12]: e296951600000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
[13]: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

The target of this token transfer is `0xbdd077f651ebe7f7b3ce16fe5f2b025be2969516`, with an amount of `0` - which may appear harmless at a glance. But the fact that the token contract is being called using `delegatecall` is highly suspicious. Determining whether this transaction was just a benign mistake requires checking the token contract's code.

Its source code has not been published anywhere, but its decompilation is trivial and allows us to see that the contract has indeed nothing to do with tokens. Instead it sets the passed token transfer destination address within the first storage slot (`0`) and returns. But since the contract is delegate-called, this means that the first storage slot of the calling Gnosis Safe is being overwritten.

The first storage slot in Gnosis Safe typically holds the address of the current owner or the contract's "master" (the contract's controller). An attacker able to change this, is able to take control of the Gnosis Safe.

Options C and D are contradictory to what we have found above and therefore incorrect.

At this point you might have noticed that this question was based on the recent Bybit hack. If you'd like to have more information on it, take a look at [Matthieu Bonetti's write-up](https://www.lrqa.com/en/cyber-labs/the-$1.5bn-bybit-theft-what-happened/), upon which this explanation is largely based on. Also take a look at [pcaversaccio](https://x.com/pcaversaccio/status/1892976342649466916)'s script which could have helped preventing this incident.

### Question 2 of 8

Analyze the following scenario and answer what was the biggest OpSec failure:

> Alice steps off the stage at the Global DeFi Summit in New York, adrenaline still rushing from her presentation. She had just introduced MuerucesDAO’s latest features to a big institutional crowd using the battered ASUS "Windows Threshold 1" laptop her mother gifted her when she got the job a few years ago. Outside in the lobby, she connects into a network called "Free-GlobalDeFi-WiFi" requiring a simple registration form over plain HTTP that barely registers as a concern at the moment. She just needs to send a few emails before catching her flight home.
> 
> At a corner table she makes eye contact with Surazal, a nice developer she’d met earlier. He’s been helpful, helping her to upgrade video drivers so her presentation would shine in 4K. She recalls him fiddling with a small HDMI dongle on her laptop promising improved compatibility. Right now though, she’s not thinking about Surazal’s configurations. Her phone vibrates with an urgent email from what appears to be MuerucesDAO’s CFO: they need her signature to rebalance $1.5 billion from the treasury to a new vault contract. The message includes a shortened link “https://tinyurl.com/yfbyf2ub”, with a note urging her to “please hurry”.
> 
> Alice blindly clicks the link and browses to the site, notices it loads slowly. A large figure flickers on the screen. No obvious red flag scams in the interface, but then again, she’s pressed for time. Her plane leaves in a few hours. She unzips a pocket in her bag and pulls out her Ledger Nano X. She’s aware she hasn’t updated it in ages, but that can wait for another day, right? After plugging the Ledger in, the device lags while retrieving transaction data. Some fields read uncomprehensive hexadecimal but the final prompt states it needs her confirmation. She gives a quick glance at the approximate total… it’s about the same as the rebalancing request. "That’s good enough" - she thinks, and clicks the tiny Ledger buttons to confirm.
> 
> Fifteen minutes later, her phone lights up with frantic calls. The CFO is in full panic mode: the entire $1.5 billion in stablecoins has just vanished, wired off to some mysterious address. Nobody can make sense of it, but she was the last one to sign.

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Using an unsecured conference WiFi portal with a MITM server changed the transaction mid-way. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. Blind signing a transaction on the Ledger Nano X despite not understanding what it displayed. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Installing suspicious video drivers from Surazal on her Windows work computer. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Clicking an urgent email link to a dApp from her colleague without verifying its sender nor target website. </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B.**

Have you noticed Pablo's easter eggs? MuerucesDAO is SecureumDAO. Surazal is Lazarus.

**A**: Transactions are cryptographically signed and cannot be changed by a Man-In-The-Middle attack. It is true however that, after signing up to get access to the unsecured conference WiFi, she should have turned on a VPN to reduce the risk of such attacks.

**B**: This was indeed the crux of the attack. Keeping her hardware wallet updated might have prevented this, as such updates may come with improvements in readability of transaction data.

**C**: The way that Surazal helped was certainly highly suspicious and there's a good chance that Alice's laptop has been infected with malware. The main purpose of using dedicated hardware wallets is exactly this scenario though - had Alice not blindly signed the transaction, she would've likely been able to notice something suspicious despite her laptop being infected.

**D**: It's indeed a very bad practice to blindly click on links without any verification of where they might lead and whether they are legitimate. But this was not the main culprit of the issue at hand.

### Question 3 of 8

What seed values did Profanity rely on, enabling the attacker’s brute‑force?

> A junior developer at MuerucesDAO wanted a catchy Ethereum vanity address for the project’s treasury. They used the open source tool Profanity to generate an address that began with “0xFAF0…”. Two days after launch, the wallet was emptied: an attacker brute‑forced the private key in minutes.

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. 32-bit value using unsigned integers. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. 256‑bit value from classic /dev/urandom. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. 64‑bit basic value derived from the current Unix timestamp. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. 128‑bit entropy string from a BIP‑39 mnemonic. </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is A.**

> In September 2022, users of Profanity, a vanity address generator for Ethereum, were the targets of an attack. Attackers took advantage of a weakness in the wallet’s key generation process to access and drain $3.3 million in tokens from users’ wallets.

> Generation of random values, such as private keys, is commonly performed using a cryptographic pseudorandom number generator (CPRNG) seeded with a random value. In this case, **Profanity seeded the CPRNG with an unsigned integer, meaning that there were only 232 (about 4.3 billion) possible seed values**.

### Question 4 of 8

How did Alice get doxxed?

> Late one evening, Alice receives a message from Surazal, a nice developer she met at a conference while talking about NFT's. He tells her how much he loves her Facebook page about NFTs and recommends her to download a new wallet called NFTViewer - available only for Android - which renders images by pulling them straight from the URLs embedded in each token’s metadata. Surazal sends her an NFT and tells her to check it out, curious, Alice taps “View”.
> 
> The next day, Surazal appears at Alice's door demanding Bitcoin to leave her alone.

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Surazal scanned Alice's Facebook page and used the WHOIS IP address to find her street. Alice should have hidden the WHOIS IP address details. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. The NFT’s metadata loaded a hidden HTML page that exploited an old Android WebView bug to read nearby WiFi SSIDs. Surazal matched the strongest SSID to a WiGle database and located her building. Alice should have kept her Android OS up to date. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. The NFT image URL pointed to Surazal’s server. NFTViewer fetched it directly, exposing Alice’s home IP. Alice should view the NFT only while connected to a VPN. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. Alice uploaded photos to Facebook straight from her phone. Their EXIF data still contains GPS coordinates so Surazal extracted the coordinates and mapped them to her address. Alice should have stripped EXIF metadata (or taken photos with geotagging off) before publishing them on Facebook. </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is C.**

**A**: It's indeed possible for an attacker to use WHOIS information to determine the owner of a domain, including the owner's address. But this doesn't apply for Facebook pages.

**B**: Something like this is certainly possible, but a such a vector typically requires a high level of sophistication from the attacker. You'd expect Alice to be a high-value target and the attacker to be a state actor or belonging to some other criminal organization.

**C**: As you might be aware, it's often only the NFT metadata that is actually stored on blockchains. Due to the high storage cost of data on blockchains, the actual NFT contents are usually off-chain, on services like IPFS. But there's nothing preventing NFT creators from hosting them on their own server. [An attacker can create a unique NFT solely for the victim such that, when they view it, the victim's IP address is leaked](https://medium.com/@alxlpsc/critical-privacy-vulnerability-getting-exposed-by-metamask-693c63c2ce94). This can indeed lead to the attacker roughly determining the victim's location, although I'd argue that it's unlikely the IP address alone would be sufficient to find Alice's house on its own in most cases.

**D**: Facebook generally strips EXIF data from photos for privacy reasons. Though that doesn't mean that users aren't often voluntarily giving more than sufficient information for an experienced OSINT analyst to determine a user's exact location. Personally, I'd actually say this was the more likely vector to truly dox Alice's home address in this case.

### Question 5 of 8

Analyze the scenario below and select the correct answer.

```plaintext showLineNumbers
Alice, a seasoned validator operator running 32 validators for a
major L1 blockchain noticed unauthorized withdrawal credentials
changes on March 15th, 2024 at 03:14 UTC. The attacker managed to

## Additional Context
- Alice's GitHub shows 1,432 commits in the last year
- Her AWS infrastructure uses strict IAM roles
- Regular security audits (last one: February 28th)
- All SSH keys are rotated monthly
- Backup seeds stored in multiple bank vaults
- Surazal's contributions have been exceptional
- Team recently moved to using hardware security keys
```

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. The AWS CloudWatch metrics integration exposed internal validator metrics through a misconfigured IAM role, allowing the attacker to intercept signing operations. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. A malicious device was connected to the air-gapped signing machine shortly before the compromise, likely capturing HSM interactions. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. Developer Surazal socially engineered Alice, gained access to the backup seeds through the GPG key trust chain after his key was added to the trusted developers list. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. The Yubikey firmware update from the manufacturer contained a supply chain attack that compromised the HSM's authentication mechanism. </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is B.**

The fact that the attacker managed to extract ETH means that he somehow managed to compromise the air-gapped signing machine. The first unauthorized withdrawal happened on March 15. at 03:14 UTC. Just before that, a Human-Input-Device was attached to the air-gapped signing machine via USB:

```plaintext
Mar 15 03:12:45 signer-01 kernel: usb0: unknown HID device attached
Mar 15 03:12:47 signer-01 kernel: usb0: device identifies as "USB Advanced Input Device"
```

There are USB-devices, often referred to as "Bad USB", that are made to look like innocent USB sticks, but in reality they're capable of acting like input devices, such as a keyboard, in order to run certain commands on the machine they are attached to.

This is likely what happened here.

### Question 6 of 8

Select the best OPSEC setup.

<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> A. Purism Librem 14 + ProtonMail Bridge + quantum-resistant YubiKey + military-grade faraday backpack + biometric-encrypted Ledger + neural-network firewall + SOCKS proxy. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> B. GrapheneOS Pixel + Coldcard + Signal + ProtonMail + faraday bag + yubikey. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> C. iPhone 15 + ToR + ProtonMail + Signal + Home cloud encrypted backup + Authy 2FA. </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> D. LineageOS + Brave Browser + DuckDuckGo + NordVPN + Telegram + Bitwarden. </li>
</ul>

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is .**

**A**: This option is full of fancy buzzwords. I'm also unaware of the existence of a "biometric-encrypted Ledger". It's highly unlikely for Ledger to ever base the encryption, or generation of, private keys upon biometrics which can not be changed but easily stolen.

**B**: A reasonable setup, with hardware wallet and a lack of fancy buzzwords.

**C**: No dedicated hardware wallet? Not a good idea in the OPSEC context of crypto-projects.

**D**: Also no mentioned of a dedicated hardware wallet device. It should further be noted that the LineageOS project's focus is device longevity and broad compatibility rather than security.

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is D.**

**A**: The first option is once again filled with fancy buzzwords that don't really make much sense aside from possibly being good marketing to the uninformed. 

**B**: This setup appears to focus on the protection of privacy, rather than the security of operations for a high profile crypto project. 

**C**: Suggests an enterprise-grade setup that is not applicable to the given use case.

In Pablo's own words on **D**:

> "good opsec can be simple. a good team would use this setup to keep operation execution high while staying secure."

<HiddenSolution>
**Correct is C.**

It's simple to tell that the given file is obfuscated JavaScript. We can also recognize from keywords like `NODE_ENV`, that this is script supposed to be executed with NodeJS, and not in the browser.

We can get further hints on the script's purpose by decoding some of the base64 strings contained:

```bash
echo QXBwRGF0YS9Mb2NhbC9Hb29nbGUvQ2hyb21lL1VzZXIgRGF0YS9EZWZhdWx0L0xvY2FsIFN0b3JhZ2UvbGV2ZWxkYg== | base64 --decode
# AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default/Local Storage/leveldb

echo QXBwRGF0YS9Mb2NhbC9FeG9kdXM= | base64 --decode
# AppData/Local/Exodus

echo c2VlZA== | base64 --decode
# seed

echo aHR0cHM6Ly9hdHRhY2tlci5jb20vd2ViaG9vaw== | base64 --decode
# https://attacker.com/webhook

echo QXBwRGF0YS9Sb2FtaW5nL0VsZWN0cnVtL3dhbGxldHM= | base64 --decode
# AppData/Roaming/Electrum/wallets

echo QXBwRGF0YS9Sb2FtaW5nL2Rpc2NvcmRwdGIvTG9jYWwgU3RvcmFnZS9sZXZlbGRi | base64 --decode
# AppData/Roaming/discordptb/Local Storage/leveldb

echo QXBwRGF0YS9Sb2FtaW5nL01vemlsbGEvRmlyZWZveC9Qcm9maWxlcw== | base64 --decode
# AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles
```

After decoding a few of the strings, we can already make a good guess on what it does: It appears to access information from cryptocurrency wallets (Exodus, Electrum), the databases of browsers (Chrome, Firefox) and apps (Discord). It also appears to look for a "seed" and communicate with a webhook belonging to the attacker.

A quick Internet search reveals that there exists indeed an open source malware called "Wish Stealer" that fits what we've found perfectly.
