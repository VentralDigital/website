<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">There are three fundamental aspects on how GrapheneOS defends itself against security vulnerabilities: It reduces the amount of &quot;surface&quot; (ie. active functionality/code) that is exposed to potential attackers, makes the exploitation of vulnerabilities as difficult as possible, and sandboxes (ie. isolates) components from each other to decrease the impact of a vulnerability being exploited. As such measures impact usability and device performance, GrapheneOS allows users to choose their own preferences via various toggles in the settings.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-244">244</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-248">248</a>]</sup></p>

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">User data is stored in an encrypted manner with a key that is derived from, among other things, your chosen screen lock-method. That these can&#x27;t simply be bypassed using brute force is ensured by delays enforced by &quot;secure element&quot; hardware.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-281">281</a>]</sup> Thanks to this measure, even a random 6 digit PIN provides a high level of security. If you don&#x27;t want to depend on the security of the secure element, you can make use of long passwords with up to 128 characters.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-258">258</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Unlocking using a pattern was removed from GrapheneOS as it is essentially a much worse version of a PIN and encourages unsafe pattern choices.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-177">177</a>]</sup> Instead, you should use at least a 6 digit PIN and consider turning on the PIN scrambling feature which raises the difficulty of figuring out the combination by an observer, fingerprint marks or side channels.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-257">257</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Fingerprint Unlock can be configured, though for best security you should consider restricting it to authentication within apps (ie. disabling <em>&#x27;Use for screen unlocking&#x27;</em>). Recently, Graphene&#x27;s 2-factor fingerprint unlock feature has been released which allows a fingerprint+PIN combination to be used as a secondary unlock method.

Continued use after the first unlock often leads to unencrypted data accumulating in the device&#x27;s ephemeral memory, which is something that forensic companies exploit.

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Although it&#x27;s possible for applications to put sensitive data back to rest when the device locks, it&#x27;s upon the developers to actually implement them that way - which rarely happens.

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">LTE and 5G do come with a form of encryption, but this is mostly intended for the protection of the network itself and not for the protection of your privacy.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-275">275</a>]</sup> No matter which mode you&#x27;re using, you should avoid traditional phone calls and text using the cellular network, and instead use end-to-end encrypted messengers such as Signal and SimpleX. In fact, if you can, always prefer using Wi-Fi over cellular.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-101">101</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-106">106</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-160">160</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">The traditional telephone system is historically insecure and not designed with the goal of protecting user&#x27;s privacy. You can imagine it like a walled garden where, once you&#x27;ve become a trusted party with access into it, you gain a significant amount of information and control over the network. This access can be bought for a few thousand USD per month and allows intercepting phone calls, SMS messages, and in some cases even roughly tracking someone&#x27;s location. To do that an attacker needs your SIM card&#x27;s unique IMSI identifier, but often it can be looked up simply by knowing your phone number. Using this the attacker would be able to intercept a 2-factor-authentication SMS while ensuring that your phone would not give any indication that such an SMS was ever sent to your number at all.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-129">129</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-283">283</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-300">300</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">When your phone authenticates with the cellular network it does so while providing information on both your SIM card and the device&#x27;s cellular radio hardware. If you&#x27;ve bought both the phone and SIM anonymously, you&#x27;re essentially using a persistent pseudonym. Since hardware information is being shared, replacing the SIM alone is not sufficient for a fresh identity.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-96">96</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-125">125</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-127">127</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">At this point, you might be considering using an external device, like a dedicated mobile hotspot, which would be much cheaper to regularly swap out together with a new SIM card. While this will increase your privacy, it will hurt your security as these devices typically have much worse hardware isolation and are way behind on security updates.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-127">127</a>]</sup> Compared to using the isolated internal radio of your Pixel, this will make it much easier for an attacker to gain control over the dedicated device, and if it is connected to your Pixel via USB this opens up a massive surface for attacking your phone.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-99">99</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-128">128</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-135">135</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-176">176</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Some of these dedicated cellular devices allow spoofing the IMEI, ie. changing the hardware identifier to an arbitrary value. This would allow you to reuse the same dedicated device and simply change the IMEI value together with a new SIM card for obtaining a new identity on the network. You should know however that the IMEI is not the only hardware-specific identifier that cellular radios leak and, furthermore, there are ways to create &quot;fingerprints&quot; of these devices that could allow re-identifying them even with identifiers changed. In the worst case, you could even draw a lot of attention to yourself when the spoofing is too obvious.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-96">96</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-97">97</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-98">98</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-128">128</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">The GrapheneOS project does not recommend using a secondary device for cellular communication, but if you really want to do it then it would be better to use another Pixel device with GrapheneOS installed for it.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-97">97</a>]</sup> Note that if you&#x27;re sharing cellular Internet via Wi-Fi, it&#x27;s possible that someone nearby tracks your movements by tracking the signals of your Wi-Fi access point.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-128">128</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>What about airplane mode?</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Airplane mode is the only way to fully disable the cellular radio transmit, receive, and tracking capabilities of your device, and works appropriately on all Pixels. Once in airplane mode, Wi-Fi can be re-enabled and used without activating the cellular radio again.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-106">106</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-283">283</a>]</sup> If you intend to use your Pixel as a Wi-Fi-only device, you should consider removing the quick tile (the airplane-mode toggle visible when swiping down the status top-bar) so that you won&#x27;t re-enable it by accident.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-197">197</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">You should be aware that cellular is not the only way carrier services can be used. Remember that there&#x27;s Wi-Fi calling and texting. To prevent the SIM from authenticating with the carrier and using their network services via other Internet connections, you need to disable the SIM itself.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-96">96</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-101">101</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-197">197</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Newer devices have special offline tracking systems intended to locate lost devices. GrapheneOS does not support and will not support these systems. If you want to be absolutely certain, you may consider keeping it within a faraday bag while you&#x27;re not using it.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-97">97</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-228">228</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>What about using a data-only SIM?</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">It doesn&#x27;t particularly matter whether you&#x27;re using a data-only SIM card in terms of privacy, you&#x27;re still authenticated to the cellular network. Not having texts and calls however does reduce attack surface for exploits. GrapheneOS may in the future add toggles to disable these capabilities to practically turn normal SIM cards into data-only equivalents.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-171">171</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>What about using a VPN?</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Using a VPN has no influence on carrier-based calls or texts. These functions will not go through the VPN even if you are using a Wi-Fi connection instead of cellular.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-234">234</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>What about data-saver mode?</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Enabling the data-saver toggle will globally (ie. in all user profiles) stop apps from using cellular data in the background. Apps that use foreground services, meaning those apps that keep themselves running in the foreground via a permanent notification, are excluded from this restriction. Mobile data use can also be restricted per app.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-196">196</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>What about using no SIM?</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">If you have no SIM card, and you are not in airplane mode, your device will still connect to the cellular network but it will not authenticate and should also not share any hardware identifiers. You will still be able to make emergency calls and receive emergency alerts. Note that making an emergency call will share radio identifiers of your device.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-197">197</a>]</sup></p>

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">So far we&#x27;ve discussed how to protect our device from outside threats, but it&#x27;s just as important to ensure that none of the installed applications can take over from the inside. Apps on Android always run isolated within their own sandbox<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-233">233</a>]</sup>, limiting the resources they can access to those that they have been given permission for.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-301">301</a>]</sup> Malicious apps may request and use permissions for purposes unrelated to the app&#x27;s core functionality, others may even attempt breaking out of their sandbox.

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Under <em>App Exploit Protection</em> you can find various measures that will increase the difficulty of an application breaking out of its sandbox. Many of them are not enabled for user-installed apps by default because they may cause those apps to crash or not work properly. But it&#x27;s better to turn them on by default globally and then turn them off selectively for those apps that have trouble.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-32">32</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-56">56</a>]</sup></p>

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>Permissions</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">In stock Android, permissions only exist for accessing the Camera, Microphone, Body Sensors, and Activity Recognition. Access to accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, barometer, thermometer, and any other sensors are simply given to apps by default without requiring any explicit consent. GrapheneOS adds a toggle to prevent access to these sensors being given by default. Since this too can cause crashes in applications that expect to receive valid data from these sensors, this measure is not active in a fresh GrapheneOS installation. Turning it on will notify you when apps attempted accessing such a sensor and you&#x27;ll be able to selectively grant this permission according to your own judgment.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-252">252</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Another permission that stock Android implicitly grants to all applications is access to networking functions. This includes device-local networking (localhost) which is currently a known way to bypass user profile isolation and allows apps of different profiles to communicate with each other. In GrapheneOS you&#x27;ll be asked whether you want to grant this permission during the installation of an app. When the Network permission is not granted to an app, GrapheneOS pretends the network is down, which is usually handled by apps in a graceful manner.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-252">252</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Just like you can disable app exploit protections on a per-app basis, you can take away permissions from apps according to your own judgment. Be careful to not remove any permissions from system apps that are installed by default though, as this can cause unforeseen issues.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-230">230</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>Scoped Access</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">There are popular apps that demand rather invasive permissions such as access to all contacts or all files on the device. Graphene&#x27;s scope functionality allows selecting a subset of contacts or files to which access is granted while the app in question will believe to have been given access to everything.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-269">269</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">By default, contact scopes act as if the contacts list is empty and users can then grant different kinds of access to specific contacts or groups of contacts.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-255">255</a>]</sup> Access to contacts is quite granular, allowing you to only share specific data with the app instead of the full contact info.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-75">75</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Users can enable storage scopes instead of granting the storage permission to apps.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-254">254</a>]</sup> This will have the effect that the app can&#x27;t see any of the files that were created by other apps, unless the user explicitly specifies files or directories that it should be allowed full access to.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-268">268</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">The GrapheneOS project is planning to add similar access scopes for other things such as Location, Camera, and Microphone.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-76">76</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>Microphone &amp; Camera toggles</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Although these are available in stock Android too, it might be noteworthy that there are toggles for disabling access to the microphone and camera. They are also available as quick tiles when swiping down the status top-bar.</p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">While it might be tempting to disable access to these globally and only turn them on when needed, this might end up being very inconvenient when you quickly intend to snap a photo (eg. via the power button double-press shortcut) or when you want to accept a call while the phone is still locked.

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>Cross-Profile Notifications</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">As visible in the screenshot above, it&#x27;s noteworthy that you can actually receive notifications from another profile that is running in the background. Although the notification will only tell you in what profile it happened and by what app it was triggered, this is still an addition by GrapheneOS that significantly improves the user experience with secondary user profiles.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-7">7</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-25">25</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>Example Use Cases</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Before continuing on the different types of user profiles available, we should first discuss what even the advantages of using multiple profiles, compared to only using the Owner profile, are.</p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">First of all, after setting up a new user you&#x27;ll be greeted by a phone that appears to be in the state of being started for the first time. None of the user-apps you&#x27;ve already installed are there, everything is empty.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-261">261</a>]</sup> This can be very useful if you want to log into different users of the same application, eg. if you want to use a messenger with multiple accounts, but the app does not support that, you can simply install it twice in different profiles.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-233">233</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Separating apps between different profiles will also prevent them from easily being able to communicate with each other. For example, there&#x27;s the normal Facebook platform app but also the separate Facebook Messenger app. If both apps agree to it, they can use something akin to inter-process communication to exchange information between each other - but only if both of them are running within the same user profile.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-25">25</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-261">261</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">As mentioned, if you have apps that run in the background of your Owner profile, they will always be running unless you manually stop them from doing so. If you have applications that you rarely make use of, it makes sense to install them in a secondary user profile. Once you&#x27;re done with them you can hold the device&#x27;s power button and you&#x27;ll be offered to end that user&#x27;s session. This will make sure that all apps of that profile are stopped and their data is put to rest and fully encrypted.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-281">281</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">You can also create and use user profiles only temporarily and immediately delete them afterward. As apps installed within one user are not aware of the other users, you can use profiles like a browser&#x27;s incognito mode. A profile&#x27;s filesystem is completely isolated from other profiles, and although you could set up a storage scope to achieve the same, there&#x27;ll be no need to do that since your temporary profile will be empty.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-282">282</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Further above, we&#x27;ve talked about how the Auto-Reboot feature was added to ensure that data is eventually put to rest and no unencrypted data will be available for forensic companies to extract. If you employ a secondary user profile instead of the Owner for your regular usage, this will be much less of a problem: While putting the Owner&#x27;s data at rest requires a reboot, putting a secondary user&#x27;s data at rest simply requires ending their session.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-281">281</a>]</sup></p>

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>Cross-Profile App installation</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">You might be surprised to find out that it&#x27;s possible for user profiles to update each other&#x27;s apps, and also for the Owner user to be able to install his app into another profile. Didn&#x27;t we say that the file systems of each profile are completely isolated? Well, yes - but it&#x27;s not like each profile is running on a completely independent operating system, and it turns out that the code of applications isn&#x27;t actually stored within each user but in the underlying system that is shared between all of them.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-113">113</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">The fact that the Owner is able to install apps in other profiles as long as they&#x27;re already installed on the Owner means that we don&#x27;t actually need to install app stores in every profile to get the apps we need. Instead, we could use the Owner profile as an &quot;App Command Center&quot;<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-232">232</a>]</sup>: We install app stores solely in the Owner user. When we install new apps we uncheck giving them the Network permission and immediately mark them as disabled.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-263">263</a>]</sup> Then we open the user management and install the newly installed apps into the profile where we&#x27;ll actually use them.</p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">There are some inconveniences that come from making active use of secondary user profiles. For example, the Auto-Reboot feature will cause all user sessions to end and throws you back to unlocking the Owner profile first. That also means that all apps in those profiles will be forced to stop running and you&#x27;ll miss out on receiving notifications from them until you log back into that user. Assuming you didn&#x27;t set a very short time for Auto-Reboots, this shouldn&#x27;t happen too often though.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-224">224</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">As mentioned, the file systems of profiles are completely isolated, which means there&#x27;s no native way to eg. share a meme that you saw on social media in one profile via a messenger that is running in another profile. Typical workarounds include having <a href="https://cryptomator.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">cloud-based file synchronization<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> or a messenger installed within both profiles - but that will require an Internet connection and potentially wastes your mobile data. You could set up local file synchronization using apps like <a href="https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">Syncthing<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> or an FTP server+client app - but these are usually annoying to set up. If you&#x27;re already on Linux with a KDE desktop you might as well use <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">KDE Connect<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> to exchange files between all of your devices and profiles. If not, the <a href="https://github.com/VentralDigital/InterProfileSharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">Inter Profile Sharing<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> app I&#x27;ve built out of frustration on this issue will hopefully be your best friend. If you really want to avoid installing any apps for this, your best option is getting a USB Stick with a USB-to-USB-C adapter.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-302">302</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">If you&#x27;re installing apps in secondary profiles that require SMS verification, you might need to temporarily enable <em>&#x27;Turn on phone calls &amp; SMS&#x27;</em> for that user.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-225">225</a>]</sup></p>

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">The private space feature is a recent addition to Android.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-67">67</a>]</sup> Technically this is simply a secondary user profile that is nested within the Owner profile: When the space is locked, the private profile user is stopped, and when the space is unlocked, the user profile is started. Except for the shared clipboard with Owner, it&#x27;s separated the same way as a secondary user profile.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-109">109</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-293">293</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">The advantage of using a private space over a secondary user profile is that the UI, in places such as notifications and settings, will be &quot;merged&quot; while the space is unlocked. That means if there&#x27;s a notification from within the private space, it will be fully displayed in the Owner profile (compared to normal secondary users where this will only show the user and app name). While this makes it slightly less isolated than a dedicated user, private spaces can be a lot more convenient.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-7">7</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-111">111</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-112">112</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Compared to having up to 31 secondary user profiles, a device can only have a single private space and it must always be part of the Owner.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-114">114</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-124">124</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-293">293</a>]</sup> The GrapheneOS project is considering changing this though, among other improvements for private spaces.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-67">67</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-120">120</a>]</sup> It&#x27;s also noteworthy that the private space user is not listed within the user management interface, meaning features such as installing Owner apps into the private space are not available. Furthermore, locking the private space does not purge the encryption keys as well as ending a secondary user&#x27;s session would.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">A drawback of private spaces, compared to full secondary user profiles, is that it&#x27;s not possible to grant it access to <em>&#x27;phone calls &amp; SMS&#x27;</em>. This prevents verification via SMS from working and prohibits using some apps within private spaces.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-13">13</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-110">110</a>]</sup></p>

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Work profiles are similar to private spaces in terms of user experience. They were originally designed for BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) deployments for corporations, which is why you need a separate &quot;device manager app&quot; to create them.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-233">233</a>]</sup> This app, and through it the corporation it belongs to, has control and ownership over the data within the work profile.

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS calls work profiles created by apps like Shelter a &quot;poor man&#x27;s private space&quot;<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-120">120</a>]</sup>, and strongly recommends using real private spaces instead.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-109">109</a>]</sup> Like private spaces, you can only have one and it must be located in the Owner profile.

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Private spaces have better isolation, proper encryption, and better user interface integration with the Owner profile.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-109">109</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-120">120</a>]</sup> Work profile management apps can enable a lot of communication between the Owner user and the nested work profile.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-113">113</a>]</sup> For example, work profiles do not block the communication of applications between profiles, which may increase convenience but negatively impacts privacy and security.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-233">233</a>]</sup></p>

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">For using VPNs the general best practice is that each of your devices should have a separate VPN connection that will obtain a separate exit IP address. <sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-247">247</a>]</sup> Because of this, all profiles (including work profiles and private spaces) have their own VPN configuration by design.

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">At the moment, the GrapheneOS project only recommends using the official WireGuard app and the official Mullvad app. Mullvad is generally preferable though, as it works well with Graphene&#x27;s exploit protection features turned on.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-246">246</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-286">286</a>]</sup> To avoid fingerprinting and tracking, GrapheneOS recommends using the default, network-provided DNS servers to blend in with other users.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-285">285</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Remember that while each profile has its own VPN configuration, the underlying networking is shared. Because of that, it&#x27;s currently possible for apps with the Network permission to communicate across profiles via localhost, which is what I&#x27;m using for the Inter Profile Sharing app to function.

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">A fresh install of GrapheneOS comes with a very minimal amount of apps, and there are several reasons for that: Bundling additional apps with the operating system will increase the attack surface right from the beginning, GrapheneOS prefers users to be able to choose which apps they want to install based on their own judgment. GrapheneOS is focused on meaningful improvements to privacy and security, bundling more apps into the operating system would likely not only be outside that focus but even counter to it. GrapheneOS also wants to avoid bundling apps and services of third parties as few of those would actually be aligned with its goals and values.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-157">157</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-174">174</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-290">290</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">You may notice that among these few apps, GrapheneOS actually comes with its own &#x27;App Store&#x27;. Note that this app repository is mostly intended for the distribution of Graphene&#x27;s own first-party applications, and hardened versions of externally developed open-source apps. The list of available applications will be purposefully kept minimal, while third-party apps should seek to be included in Accrescent - the officially endorsed app store of GrapheneOS, which can be installed via Graphene&#x27;s minimal store.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-84">84</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-143">143</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-262">262</a>]</sup></p>

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Of the few apps that GrapheneOS comes with, about half of them are inherited from the Android Open Source Project with minor changes and are very primitive in terms of functionality and user experience. Many of the AOSP apps were great choices 10+ years ago when Android&#x27;s UI was more primitive and expectations were far lower. Over time Google replaced them with more modern versions for their stock OS but abandoned the open-source versions.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-185">185</a>]</sup> GrapheneOS is planning to overhaul or replace them as well, though there are often licensing issues with possible alternatives.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-174">174</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">If you prefer Google&#x27;s versions of apps such as the Camera, Gallery, and Keyboard, you can absolutely switch back to them without opting into their invasive usage statistic reporting and without uploading your photos to their service.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-94">94</a>]</sup> Some of Google&#x27;s stock Android apps, such as the screenshot editor (Markup) and the Thermometer (for Pixels with the appropriate sensor), are mirrored in Graphene&#x27;s App Store as they&#x27;re not available in the Play Store.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-85">85</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>Camera</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">The Camera app that GrapheneOS comes with has already been modernized<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-174">174</a>]</sup>, it&#x27;s focused on privacy and security and is arguably better than any of the open-source alternatives and even most paid apps. It includes modes for capturing images, videos, and QR/barcode scanning.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-273">273</a>]</sup> It has basic HDR+, Night mode, multi-camera zoom, EIS, etc. There&#x27;s no loss in terms of photo quality of the camera by running GrapheneOS instead of stock Android.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-131">131</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">But still, it does not have the full set of features offered by the stock &#x27;Pixel Camera&#x27; app. The Pixel Camera, previously Google Camera, can take full advantage of all available cameras and image processing hardware on GrapheneOS.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-188">188</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-204">204</a>]</sup>Though to reduce attack surface, direct access to low-level hardware by Google&#x27;s Apps is controlled by an extra toggle.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-273">273</a>]</sup> The <em>&#x27;Special access to hardware accelerators for Google apps&#x27;</em> toggle is enabled by default but does not grant these apps any additional access to data.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-188">188</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>Gallery</strong></p>

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>Keyboard</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Graphene&#x27;s default keyboard is essentially Google&#x27;s Gboard from 2014. It used to be an open-source project with a few closed-source components but ended up becoming entirely closed-source and rebranded to Gboard. It&#x27;s missing some features such as sliding on the space bar to move the cursor, one-handed mode, better handling of emojis, and especially swipe typing.</p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Google&#x27;s modern Gboard is definitely one of the nicest keyboards at the moment. Using it is fine as long as you don&#x27;t opt-in to usage statistics and other invasive options. Remember that active keyboards have access to all the text you&#x27;re entering, the text you&#x27;re editing and the clipboard contents at all times.</p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">If you&#x27;re looking for an open-source alternative, you should have a look at <a href="https://florisboard.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">FlorisBoard<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. Its user interface isn&#x27;t very polished yet, but it&#x27;s an improvement in terms of features compared to the default keyboard. The GrapehenOS project is considering forking and moving to it in the future.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-94">94</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>Vanadium Browser</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS includes their Vanadium subproject which is based on Chromium with enhancements in privacy and security. It&#x27;s used by both the operating system as default browser as well as by other apps that need to render web contents. The GrapheneOS project recommends this browser to be used as is; additional browser extensions or modifications are only likely to make you stand out more, making you easier to track. To prevent websites from accessing standard sensors, you can toggle off the &#x27;Sensors&#x27; permission for the browser app as a whole.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-272">272</a>]</sup></p>

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">There&#x27;s currently only a tiny subset of Android apps incompatible with GrapheneOS. These are specifically apps that make use of the Play Integrity API which requires the operating system to be officially certified by Google. This mainly affects apps of banking/financial nature, location-based competitive games like Ingress, as well as some strange outliers such as the McDonalds app, Authy, and the Uber app for drivers. By implementing it, these apps have chosen to ban the use of alternative and modified operating systems. While this makes somewhat sense for games as basic anti-cheat system, it is by far not as effective as Google makes it out to be.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-72">72</a>]</sup> <sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-130">130</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-133">133</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-136">136</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-156">156</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">This also prevents NFC payments made via Google Pay. A simple way around this restriction is using a Pixel or Galaxy Smart Watch paired with GrapheneOS.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-115">115</a>]</sup> Fortunately, there are other services, such as those provided by European banks, that have their own tap-to-pay which works on GrapheneOS.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-29">29</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-68">68</a>]</sup> For the US there&#x27;s hope that Curve Pay will be available soon.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-115">115</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-130">130</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Although GrapheneOS provides the same standard security model as stock Android does, Google certifies operating systems not based on security but whether they licensed it.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-79">79</a>]</sup> There are ways to bypass some of these restrictions, but they would likely be blocked in time and would only be a temporary workaround.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-70">70</a>]</sup> According to the GrapheneOS project, the only permanent solution is regulatory or legal action based on this being highly anti-competitive and illegal behavior.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-71">71</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-103">103</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-206">206</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0"><strong>Play Services Dependency</strong></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Another caveat to Graphene&#x27;s app compatibility is that some applications have a dependency on Google&#x27;s Play Services, which is most often the case for messengers and social media. The reason for this is that they rely on receiving events for notifications through Google servers via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Some of these apps are able to fall back to their own implementation of push messages or frequent polling, but this typically requires the app to run with a foreground service. The app may also require being given &#x27;Unrestricted&#x27; background usage, otherwise it&#x27;d be interrupted by the automatic battery optimization, causing delayed notifications.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-238">238</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-288">288</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">An example of this is Signal, which will fall back to its own push mechanism when FCM is not available. There have however been reports that this performs badly and inefficiently (draining the battery). Instead, the alternative <a href="https://molly.im/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">Molly<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> client is often recommended for use without Play Services.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-33">33</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">For apps that have a hard dependency on Play Services, you have the option to install and use the official Google Play Services restricted to the standard app sandbox. Thanks to the compatibility layer Google Play will receive absolutely no special access or privileges on GrapheneOS. It provides nearly complete compatibility aside from a small subset of functionality that hasn&#x27;t been ported yet or cannot be provided due to being inherently privileged. The Play Store and its services are fully available, including in-app purchases and app/content license checks. It can install, update, and uninstall apps as usual, assuming it has been given authorization as an app source and consent for each action.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-250">250</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">To make use of the compatibility layer, install &#x27;Google Play services&#x27; from the GrapheneOS App Store. This will also install the Play Store, which is a dependency of Play services (don&#x27;t disable the store app or the services will stop working too).<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-238">238</a>]</sup> While making use of the Play Store requires being logged in with a Google Account, there&#x27;s no need to log in if you&#x27;re only installing Play Services for app compatibility reasons.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-276">276</a>]</sup> Also note that some apps including Signal need to be installed <em>after</em> sandboxed Google Play in order to make use of it properly.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-104">104</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">After installing Play Services you&#x27;ll get a <em>&#x27;Missing optional permission&#x27;</em> notification from the compatibility layer. Tapping it will ask whether you want to allow Google Play services to always run in the background, which will keep a connection open to Google&#x27;s FCM server for reliable notifications, but will also reduce battery life. Agreeing to this will set the background usage to &#x27;Unrestricted&#x27;. Leaving it on &#x27;Optimized&#x27; will heavily restrict background usage based on how much it is used, while disallowing it will prevent background usage near totally. Make your choice depending on how important push notification timeliness via FCM is to you.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-226">226</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">In terms of security, it does not make much of a difference in which user profile you install Play Services. If you&#x27;re hoping to avoid Google as much as possible, it&#x27;s best to install it in a profile that you&#x27;re not planning to use as your main profile.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-276">276</a>]</sup> For example, if you were planning to only use your device with a single profile, it would be best to install Play Services within the Owner profile&#x27;s private space.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-58">58</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-109">109</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">I&#x27;d recommend installing Play Services in the Owner profile with background services disabled but authenticated with a Google account (it&#x27;s possible to create one anonymously). The Owner profile will only serve to download and install apps (without Network permission, and apps immediately disabled after the download) which can then be installed into other profiles via the user management UI. This way you can have a secondary user profile within which Play Services are installed with &#x27;Unrestricted&#x27; background usage, but without being authenticated to a specific Google account. Into this profile, you can install the messengers and social media apps that require FCM for reliable notifications.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-232">232</a>]</sup></p>

<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">In Android, the package files downloaded to install or update an application are cryptographically signed. Once an app has been installed, the signer of the installation package is &#x27;pinned&#x27; such that all future packages attempting to update it must have a signature of the same signer.

The GrapheneOS project intends to delegate securely hosting a wide array of third-party applications, both closed- and open-source, to Accrescent while the operating system&#x27;s own app repository will only provide first-party applications and possibly a small number of lightly modified and hardened forks of useful third-party apps.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-14">14</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-84">84</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-303">303</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">While the hope is that Accrescent will be one of the best ways to obtain apps on GrapheneOS going forward, it still lacks funding and contributors to substantially expand.

The GrapheneOS project has expressed very harsh criticism of F-Droid and does not recommend it as a secure source for third-party applications. The main reason is that F-Droid builds most of the apps directly from source on &#x27;sketchy, outdated infrastructure&#x27;, the resulting packages of which are then cryptographically signed by them, raising concern for a future mass-compromise of F-Droid users.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-22">22</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">An advantage of app packages being signed by the developer is that it requires the signing key to be compromised for the attacker to be able to create a malicious package with a valid signature. This is arguably harder to achieve than introducing malicious changes to the source code on platforms like GitHub which F-Droid would then use to blindly build a signed package from. The GrapheneOS project argues that this greatly increases the risk of supply chain attacks.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-190">190</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Another problem stems from the fact that F-Droid self-signs app builds without ensuring that their build variant has a unique app id different from the one signed by the developers. Because the Trust-On-First-Use principle requires the signers of apps with the same id to match, this often causes confusion with users who try to reinstall an application within another profile or from a different source. Only the few applications that make use of F-Droid&#x27;s reproducible build feature are excluded from this issue. For apps configured to use reproducible builds, F-Droid will discard their self-build package after verifying that it matches the developer-signed version. But at the moment it&#x27;s not even possible to easily tell which apps are actually making use of this feature.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-113">113</a>]</sup></p>

It allows you to avoid installing the official Play Store app and offers using an anonymous Google account that you share with other Aurora users. The GrapheneOS project recommends against using Aurora due to its security being weaker and some apps being affected by Aurora as the app&#x27;s source.

To this, the project clarifies that Graphene&#x27;s purpose is not specifically avoiding Google, but providing a high level of privacy and security - even for those who do not want to make great sacrifices in terms of user experience. The ongoing work to provide a fully functional compatibility layer for Google&#x27;s services is not a trivial feature but one that GrapheneOS is investing a lot of resources into.

Typical GrapheneOS-specific solutions include turning off some of the exploit protection measures, re-installing the application outside of a private space (Owner or other secondary profile), re-installing the app in a profile that provides sandboxed Google Play Services, etc.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-8">8</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-12">12</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-39">39</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-208">208</a>]</sup><sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-218">218</a>]</sup> Sometimes apps even start crashing because the application (eg. app store) from which they were installed from is no longer enabled or installed<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-241">241</a>]</sup>, or they refuse to work properly because they were not installed from the source that they expected.<sup class="font-mono text.xs text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-19">19</a>]</sup></p>

Try using the duress PIN/password you&#x27;ve configured in Owner from a secondary user. It will wipe the device in the same way. It has multiple user support just not in the described way. You probably don&#x27;t want one which only works when you&#x27;re trying to log into a specific user and only deletes that user. You may want a form of it which only wipes specific secondary users, but that&#x27;s different than having one that&#x27;s specific to logging into a particular user. It&#x27;s also worth noting that the duress PIN/password can be entered anywhere the PIN/password can be entered. If you enter it on PIN/password request for enabling developer options or changing certain settings, it&#x27;s going to wipe the device in the same way as unlocking the device. We integrated it right after the check for the correct PIN/password in a universal way. We could extend it to working for SIM PIN entry too but we didn&#x27;t do that in the initial implementation. It&#x27;d likely make sense to do it for SIM PIN entry but just wasn&#x27;t in the initial phase. If for some strange reason you set the duress PIN/password and the real PIN/password to the same value it won&#x27;t wipe the device since it checks for the real one first. We thought a lot about how to do it well and even behavior of having corrupt data you can&#x27;t decrypt is intended. It wipes the hardware keystore keys which among other things prevents deriving any of the key encryption keys for encryption. Booting will initially fail because it can&#x27;t derive key encryption keys. After trying again, it will give up and show the prompt to wipe and reformat. We plan to enhance it by also wiping a couple other things which also prevent deriving the key encryption keys.

That&#x27;s why the auto-reboot timer we added in June 2021 is configuration. We moved to a 72 hour default and then 18 hours but people can set it as low as 10 minutes if they want it. It&#x27;s possible to try to keep more data at rest in AFU but it heavily depends on apps. Even Signal has shown zero interest in keeping most of their database at rest while locked. There&#x27;s a fork of it on Android called Molly which does implement keeping the database at rest. iOS makes it a bit easier than Android to keep data at rest while locked than Android, but yet there are better options for apps taking advantage of it on Android including 2FA apps and other things. It&#x27;s not a lot of apps taking advantage of it and not super mainstream ones. Another example is that Android offers the Chromium layer-1 sandbox to every app as an isolatedProcess toggle for out-of-process services. It&#x27;s easy to use. It&#x27;s essentially not used in anything other than the OS and Chromium-based browsers. App developers do not do hardening... People might reasonably think Signal, etc. try to harden a lot against getting exploited via media, WebRTC, etc. and they&#x27;d be wrong. WebRTC in Signal is based on the Chromium implementation but doesn&#x27;t sandbox it like Chromium does. At least they&#x27;ve gotten better at updating it. Trying to get app developers to opt-in to keeping data at rest when locked is never going to work out. Even if they&#x27;d done things the other way around and developers had to opt-in to not keeping it at rest when locked, most apps would probably just opt-in for all their data. The OS probably just needs to offer a per-app toggle for apps getting frozen while locked with all their data put at rest, which still won&#x27;t benefit most users but at least people who are at risk can be told to use it and can enabled the feature for Signal, etc.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1859406214746042771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1859406214746042771<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-50" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-50">50</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, November 20. <em>&quot;GrapheneOS is a Linux distribution too.

We recently published a detailed thread about this here: <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1818414579153596422" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1818414579153596422<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. We&#x27;re in contact with the regulators in MULTIPLE countries about this. Don&#x27;t fall for Google pretending Play Integrity API is security related or that their licensing system is about compatibility. Android and Chromium would massively benefit from proper collaboration between stakeholders without Google&#x27;s business model getting in the way. Should be forced to deal with both following the model of the LLVM Foundation and also spin off Google Play into an independent company. Google is actively cracking down on competition in the mobile space by convincing app developers to use their Play Integrity API. Play Integrity API bans using operating systems not licensing Google&#x27;s apps/services and agreeing to highly restrictive and anti-competitive terms. Google&#x27;s licensing agreement directly bans OEMs from working with GrapheneOS and producing phones with it. Google sabotages their own products such as the Play Store to boost core monopolies. If it was a competitive market, they&#x27;d want their apps and services available to any OS. GrapheneOS has demonstrated Google Play works well as regular sandboxed apps without any special integration into the OS via our sandboxed Google Play feature. Google should be forced to spin off Google Play into an independent company competing with other app stores / services.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1820902008519569873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1820902008519569873<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-72" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-72">72</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, July 30. <em>&quot;<a href="https://x.com/arstechnica/status/1818325952553947517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/arstechnica/status/1818325952553947517<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> The article unfortunately leaves out most of the points we made in the thread. GrapheneOS supports hardware-based attestation and it&#x27;s entirely possible for Google to allow it as part of the Play Integrity API. They choose to ban using GrapheneOS. Play Integrity API has no minimum security patch level and nearly all these apps use weak software-based checks that are easily bypassed by attackers. The hardware-based checks rely on trusting every key distributed to every certified Android device, which are often leaked. Hardware-based attestation can be used for security purposes such as verifying device integrity with a pinning-based approach without the weakness of being vulnerable to leaked keys from the whole Android ecosystem since specific per-app keys in the secure element can be pinned. Play Integrity API is claimed to be based on devices complying with the Compatibility Test Suite and Compatibility Definition Document. We have irrefutable proof that the majority of certified Android devices do not comply with the CTS/CDD. Play Integrity API is based on lies. Essentially every non-Pixel device has important CTS failures not caused by CTS bugs. OEMs are cheating to obtain certification. Google claims GrapheneOS can&#x27;t be permitted because we don&#x27;t have a certification where they freely allow cheating and don&#x27;t ban non-compliant devices. Since Play Integrity doesn&#x27;t even have a minimum security patch level, it permits a device with multiple years of missing patches. Hardware attestation was required on all devices launched with Android 8 or later, but they don&#x27;t enforce it to permit non-compliant devices. The reality is that the Play Integrity API permits devices from companies partnered with Google with privileged Google Play integration when they&#x27;re running the stock OS. It&#x27;s easy to bypass, but they&#x27;ll make changes to block it being done at scale long term such as if we did it. It does not matter if these devices have years of missing security patches. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the companies skipped or improperly implemented mandatory security features despite that being required by CDD compliance. Failing even very important CTS tests doesn&#x27;t matter either. Google can either permit GrapheneOS in the Play Integrity API in the near future via the approach documented at <a href="https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> or we&#x27;ll be taking legal action against them and their partners. We&#x27;ve started the process of talking to regulators and they&#x27;re interested. We&#x27;re not going to give Google veto power over what we&#x27;re allowed to do in GrapheneOS. We comply with CTS and CDD except when it limits our ability to provide our users with privacy and security. Google wants to be in charge of which privacy/security features can be added. Nope. Google&#x27;s behavior in the mobile space is highly anti-competitive. Google should be forbidden from including Google Mobile Services with privileged access unavailable to regular apps and services. GrapheneOS sandboxed Google Play proves that hardly anything even needs to change. Google should also be forbidden from participating in blocking using alternate hardware/firmware/software. They&#x27;ve abused their market position to reinforce their monopolies. They&#x27;ve used security as an excuse despite what they&#x27;re doing having no relevance to it and REDUCING it. Google is forbidding people from using a growing number of apps and services on an objectively far more private and secure OS that&#x27;s holding up much better against multiple commercial exploit developers: <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1815105015079416062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1815105015079416062<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. They&#x27;re holding back security, not protecting it. We&#x27;ve put a lot of effort into collaborating with Google to improve privacy and security for all Android users. Their business team has repeatedly vetoed even considering giving us partner access. They rolled back us being granted security partner access by the security team. As with how they handle giving out partner access, the Play Integrity API serves the interests of Google&#x27;s business model. They have no valid excuse for not allowing GrapheneOS to pass device and strong integrity. If app developers want to ban it, they can still do it themselves. After our security partner access was revoked, we stopped most of our work on improving Android security. We continued reporting vulnerabilities upstream. However, we&#x27;re going to stop reporting most vulnerabilities until GrapheneOS is no longer blocked by the Play Integrity API. This year, we reported multiple serious vulnerabilities to Android used by widely used commercial exploit tools: <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/overview/acknowledgements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://source.android.com/docs/security/overview/acknowledgements<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. If Google wants more of that in the future, they can use hardware attestation to permit GrapheneOS for their device/strong integrity checks. Authy&#x27;s response about their usage of the Play Integrity API shows their service is highly insecure and depends on having client side validation. Play Integrity is thoroughly insecure and easily bypassed, so it&#x27;s unfortunate that according to Authy their security depends on it. If Authy insists on using it, they should use the standard Android hardware attestation API to permit using GrapheneOS too. It&#x27;s easy to do: <a href="https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. Banning 250k+ people with the most secure smartphones from using your app is anti-security, not pro-security. It&#x27;s very unfortunate when new apps adopt the Play Integrity API and stop working. Authy isn&#x27;t a very good choice for 2FA but many people use it and it&#x27;s a problem for us for a widely used app to be incompatible. A single widely used app losing compatibility is a big deal to us.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1818414579153596422" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1818414579153596422<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-73" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-73">73</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, November 12. <em>&quot;GrapheneOS since June 2021 and iOS since 18.1 in October 2024 are starting a timer when the device is locked and rebooting the device when the timer elapses without a successful unlock.

In order to make it easy to install sandboxed Google Play, our App Store provides mirrors of the official releases. These have through extensive testing by users either opting into the Alpha and Beta channels for those in our App Store along or Beta releases in the Play Store. Our compatibility layer teaches Play services and the Play Store how to function as regular apps via the standard Android APIs and permissions. It&#x27;s not necessary to grant any permissions to either of them in order to use them and provide compatibility with near 100% of apps. Apps with mandatory or optional dependencies on Google Play are including Google Play libraries in their app. Many of these libraries such as Ads and Analytics work fine without Google Play services. These libraries could do everything sandboxed Google Play can do without it. For example, Google could include fallback code in the Firebase Cloud Messaging library to support receiving push messages through a service run by the app itself. Google could also support using Play services and Play Store as sandboxed apps. We&#x27;ve shown it works fine that way. It&#x27;s important to understand that our approach is not granting any access to them or allowing them to do anything they couldn&#x27;t do without it. Our compatibility layer demonstrates a regulator could reasonably require Google to not use capabilities unavailable to regular apps. Our approach also allows us to reimplement arbitrary portions of Google Play ourselves. For example, we reimplement the Play services location service by using the OS location service. By default, apps using Google Play location are redirected to standard GrapheneOS location. We provide emulated network location support to use apps depending on network location without it. We&#x27;re in the process of implementing our own network location client with support for choosing between multiple services. It&#x27;s currently being tested and polished up to ship it. Our opt-in network location that&#x27;s going to be shipped soon is not tied to Google Play compatibility. It&#x27;s available to any apps using the OS location API. Our default enabled redirection means that apps using Google Play location will transparently use this when it&#x27;s enabled. We&#x27;ll also be providing support for using Apple&#x27;s location service or a GrapheneOS proxy to it as the starting point. We&#x27;re also going to be providing our own location service based on our own database built from data scraped/merged from multiple sources which is entirely legal. Our own network location service will support downloading regional databases to use it entirely locally without sending location data to a service. We plan to provide the same features for the SUPL service used for A-GNSS which currently defaults to a GrapheneOS proxy to Google. We&#x27;re also going to be providing our own implementation of geocoding (converting addresses to location) with a choice of providers which is currently in an experimental state. We can very easily host that ourselves too. We&#x27;ll be doing the same for many other things over time. Our position is that useful features should be directly provided in the OS disconnected from Google Play compatibility. Apps using Google Play for it can be redirected to using the OS implementation instead with a toggle for it. We can also unify it with the provider toggles. For network-based location, it&#x27;s completely legal for us to scrape enormous amounts of data from publicly available services not even requiring accounts to combine into our own multi-source database. It will allow us to provide non-satellite-dependent offline location detection. We have additional extensions beyond the baseline compatibility layer to support Android Auto. It&#x27;s disabled by default, and Android Auto is a regular sandboxed app when installed. Users can choose to grant it extra USB access to use wired Android Auto. Wireless needs a lot more.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1855688621824565335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1855688621824565335<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-82" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-82">82</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, November 10. <em>&quot;Detecting location based on querying a service using nearby cell towers, Wi-Fi networks and/or Bluetooth beacons to get a location estimate. It can function in different ways, and we plan to enable doing it entirely locally via our service supporting downloading regional data. It&#x27;s an alternative to satellite-based location (GNSS) which can work well indoors in cities and can give a quicker rough estimate. GrapheneOS currently relies on satellite-based location (GNSS) with services to assist it (A-GNSS) called PSDS (database downloads) and SUPL. PSDS is a database of predicted satellite locations and topographical data to speed up satellite locking locks. We host our own cache of the data on our servers. SUPL is kind of a network location lite requesting data on a carrier&#x27;s cell towers to speed up GNSS which we proxy. [...] Apps can&#x27;t scan for nearby cell towers or Wi-Fi networks without the Location permission. IoT devices with Wi-Fi can certainly detect their location via Wi-Fi scans. Look at <a href="https://wigle.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://wigle.net<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> for an example. Apple and Google have much better databases. We don&#x27;t like that network location is based on revealing location to a service, although if it&#x27;s done with individual queries without a long live connection via a VPN that&#x27;s much less of an issue. That&#x27;s why we want local database support, requiring having our own database. Building our own db entirely with data we gather is unrealistic. It&#x27;d require having people submit huge amounts of privacy sensitive data. Our plan is to scrape the data from services like the Apple location service and merge it with data from BeaconDB (<a href="https://beacondb.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://beacondb.net<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>). The way this works in general is that you scan for nearby cell towers, Wi-Fi APs and Bluetooth devices which then get submitted to a service to get the locations of those things which can then be used to figure out location based on signal strength to each of them. Doing it with cell towers alone is already decent for a rough estimate. Wi-Fi is incredible for this in cities. This is how iOS and Android manage to provide indoor location without satellite receptions. They get nearly all users to not opt-out of it. People are used to it. [...] Wi-Fi APs should not be brought with you since their location can be found through tons of devices sending that data to Apple, Google, etc. If you move, bringing the same Wi-Fi router will give data showing someone moved from your old location to the new one. If your Wi-Fi AP simply stays in one location, that&#x27;s not a privacy issue. Hiding the SSID doesn&#x27;t change that there are packets marked as coming from and going to the MAC address for that AP. Hidden SSIDs also reduce client privacy and enable tracking. Each hidden AP hidden network you have saved on a laptop, phone, etc. is broadcast every time they scan for Wi-Fi networks. It allows tracking client devices despite MAC randomization. Should never save any hidden SSID networks. Hidden SSIDs only really reduce privacy.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1855669762535075977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1855669762535075977<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-83" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-83">83</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, November 10. <em>&quot;Pixel 5a has known unpatched remote code execution vulnerabilities.

GrapheneOS starts from the baseline of the latest Android Open Source Project and implements massive privacy and security improvements on top. Volla OS, LineageOS, CalyxOS and /e/OS roll back security rather than improving it. Ubuntu Mobile is a far further regression than those. An iPhone has much better privacy and security than those. The latest Android Open Source Project on a Pixel has competitive security with an iPhone, but not privacy, and we&#x27;re not referring to Google services but rather missing privacy features. Older releases are far worse. iPhones are far from perfect but putting putting non-hardened AOSP 13/14 on typical Qualcomm/MediaTek Android hardware is dramatically worse. Most of these options are also adding their own problematic services and Apple is in fact doing better than them at E2EE services, etc. [...] Knox is almost entirely branding for standard security features. Samsung devices don&#x27;t have competitive security with iPhones and Pixels. Samsung devices also don&#x27;t have serious alternate OS support and cripple the device including disabling important security features. In terms of security features, Samsung devices are the next best option after Pixels in the Android world, but there&#x27;s a huge gap. Security is also about more than having a bunch of good features. Samsung adds a ton of complexity and attack surface with their overall changes.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1854268559712567470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1854268559712567470<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-93" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-93">93</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, November 6. <em>&quot;CalyxOS has far worse app compatibility than GrapheneOS and doesn&#x27;t have remotely comparable privacy or security features.

It ended up becoming entirely closed source and rebranded to Gboard. You can use emojis with the default keyboard. Press and hold the enter key to show it. It&#x27;s missing emoji search, gender, skin color, more recently added emoji, etc. If people care about emoji they need FlorisBoard or Gboard. We plan to eventually migrate to another keyboard. If you don&#x27;t care about emoji, the default keyboard is fine. It&#x27;s missing some nice things like sliding on the space bar to move the cursor, one handed mode and other innovations added to Gboard after they stopped releasing the code as open source. It has the UI part of swipe typing but the library to make it work was closed source so that&#x27;s missing.

However, they can also include geofencing data inside of the alert metadata for the OS to check if it can quickly obtain the location (GNSS is usually too slow for this though).

Choosing a random IMEI would make you almost entirely unique as a starting point.

Changing the IMEi alone isn&#x27;t enough to hide the device identity from the network. It will only hide one commonly used ID rather than making the device not uniquely identifiable. Carriers often detect device model via IMEI and multiple other ways as part of their standard operating procedure. They change how things work based on the detected capabilities but also hard-wired quirks for device models, etc. Devices send a lot of info on capabilities. It&#x27;s possible to detect the devices with an IMEI not matching their capabilities/configuration or to detect that there&#x27;s a device with the IMEI changing repeatedly but the other device identifiers remaining the same. You could end up drawing attention to yourself by doing it... Similarly, using a very niche hardware device to connect to the network such as a standalone hotspot device stands out. Those devices are also far less secure than simply using a Pixel with GrapheneOS. They typically don&#x27;t get proper updates and lack basic security measures. If you really want to have cellular done from a separate device, a used Pixel with GrapheneOS is a good option. If you want a fresh identity for the cellular network, there isn&#x27;t really much alternative to using both a fresh device and SIM. Wi-Fi has a much more private design. To summarize: 1) IMEI randomization is a poor way to improve privacy and will draw attention to yourself in practice. 2) Dedicated Hotspot devices aren&#x27;t good for privacy/security. 3) Use airplane mode + Wi-Fi with our default per-connection MAC randomization for better privacy. MAC randomization alone was not enough. Wi-Fi has had major privacy improvements on common devices like iPhones and Pixels in recent years to neuter other tracking based on sequence numbers, etc. We&#x27;re aware of 1 remaining issue which has is reported/accepted as a vulnerability. Also, bear in mind that carrying around a Wi-Fi access point (AP) is the opposite of private. An AP has a persistent MAC even if it&#x27;s random upon creating the AP such as making a hotspot with a phone. Wi-Fi does not have MAC rotation like Bluetooth Low Energy privacy extensions. GrapheneOS uses per-connection MAC rand and per-connection DHCP as improvements over the standard Android Open Source Project. The MAC still remains the same while connected, and an AP isn&#x27;t going to cycle until it&#x27;s reset. Wi-Fi does not try to do what BLE privacy extensions do. To clarify, an access point means a router such as Wi-Fi hotspot from a phone. If you enable Wi-Fi hotspot, it chooses a random MAC and uses it until it&#x27;s disabled. Bluetooth LE tries to provide privacy for a paired device being carried around incl. MAC rotation. Wi-Fi does not. [...] The radio has hardware IDs so it&#x27;s very clear that it&#x27;s the same device using a new SIM. There is not much point cycling one without also cycling the other at the same time. [...] In general, you should only use the supported devices, which means Pixel 6 and later. 8th/9th generation Pixels have a much more hardened OS via hardware memory tagging. 9th generation Pixels currently have more cellular baseband hardening but it may get backported to 8th gen. We&#x27;re not at all particularly recommending using a 2nd device for cellular though. We&#x27;re just pointing out that using GrapheneOS on a used Pixel 6a would be much more secure for that purpose than using the dedicated hotspot devices. The hotspot devices are generally awful. [...] We&#x27;ve explained it in this thread: 1) There are more hardware identifiers than IMEI, IMSI and EID. Avoiding using eSIMs doesn&#x27;t avoid having more hardware identifiers than IMEI. 2) Network sees what kind of radio/device it is and how it behaves, which impacts how it functions. To expand on the 2nd point, that means if you choose a completely random IMEI instead of a random choice among IMEIs of a similar type of device, it will clearly be a device that&#x27;s using a random IMEI. By clearly having a random IMEI, that stands out a lot and invites attention. There are typically other hardware identifiers for the radio than IMEI and the eSIM ID. It is similar to how many Wi-Fi adapters largely used to leak other info and had silly things like info on the type of adapter or even a serial number included in each probe request. [...] They can uniquely identify the radio so with a non-KYC device and non-KYC SIM, you&#x27;re essentially using a persistent pseudonym. If you randomize the IMEI and switch SIMs there are still other IDs and a fully random IMEI isn&#x27;t going to match your hardware which is obvious. [...] IMEI and IMSI are the most common but there are several other common hardware identifiers including ones specific to a physical SIM and ones specific to an eSIM. It&#x27;s more complex than Wi-Fi where MAC address randomization commonly doesn&#x27;t actually work due to other IDs. Look into papers on MAC randomization not actually working. There&#x27;s some nice research on it. iPhones and Pixels made adjustments to Wi-Fi with the Wi-Fi vendors to address this but our community has found some remaining minor weaknesses which have been reported to get fixed. Cellular is far more of a mess than Wi-Fi where minimal probe information, probe sequence number randomization and a few other things combined with MAC randomization and higher level OS changes should be enough. Cellular is designed to identity the device so it&#x27;s much different. In the past, Wi-Fi hardware, firmware and drivers were not carefully designed and implementation to avoid identifying the hardware to the network. This has been largely addressed for iPhones and Pixels, and it&#x27;s trickling down to other smartphones. Laptops are more behind though. Cellular is a completely different story. It has a bunch of explicit device identifiers but also other ways it identifies itself to the network. There&#x27;s also often persistent state for the radio which can do the same thing rather than it just being completely fresh each boot. There isn&#x27;t comparable research into cellular privacy partly because of a mix of perceived and real regulatory and legal issues. People believe the issue is that changing the IMEI is illegal, but it&#x27;s often legal. The real issue is that it leaks device identity despite that... Changing the main IMEI that&#x27;s provided also doesn&#x27;t mean that the original IMEI isn&#x27;t available via diagnostic messages, but there are other identifiers. There&#x27;s also often persistent radio state usable for tracking it regardless of the device identifiers. It&#x27;s not very private. eSIM ID is a well documented identifier but there are more than those. Even aside from all the actual identifiers, there are other ways of tracking similar to how MAC randomization is not enough for Wi-Fi even if it&#x27;s the only identifier, but cellular has more than 1 identifier. [...] There are more cellular radio identifiers than IMEI. People should really be aware that they are not truly preventing uniquely identifying the device through changing the IMEI. Randomizing IMEI is easily detected and clearly stands out from other devices too. Cellular network can see what kind of radio is connecting and what capabilities there are along with there usually being some persistent state for the radio rather than each boot being an entirely fresh start. There are also other IDs. It&#x27;s just not designed to avoid tracking. It&#x27;s not specific to smartphones or particular kinds of radios, it&#x27;s cellular in general. Wi-Fi had awful privacy even with MAC randomization and often had other things like a serial number included in probe requests, etc. but there was research into it and problems got solved. Wi-Fi is still not perfect but at least on iPhones and Pixels it&#x27;s a lot better than it was. We&#x27;re aware of 1 minor issue with the Broadcom Wi-Fi radio on Pixels which only applies when connected to a network, not scanning. It has been reported and acknowledged as a security bug. [...] We&#x27;re talking about there being other hardware identifiers or even the original IMEI still being shared based on research done by our community and others including with mobile hotspot devices. It is similar to Wi-Fi MAC rand before efforts to get rid of other leaked identifiers. You know there&#x27;s an official eSIM ID (EID) for the eSIM secure element, right? That&#x27;s a clearly documented non-IMEI hardware identifier. We&#x27;re also talking about using a physical SIM though, not only eSIM. See <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10402530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10402530<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. We&#x27;re talking about more than that though. We cannot share the very minor Wi-Fi privacy issue disclosed to us because a firmware/driver patch is not available yet, but other Wi-Fi adapters often have far bigger issues and it&#x27;s a good thing that the remaining privacy issues with regular Wi-Fi usage have become so minor. The standard Broadcom Wi-Fi adapters on Nexus and other devices used to have firmware from Broadcom adding a whole bunch of unnecessary info to probe requests and other Wi-Fi packets. They also used a sequential probe sequence number and other counters. until fully reset. Some Wi-Fi adapters literally sent off a serial number not just MAC, defeating MAC randomization. Essentially all would end up having a quite unique probe sequence number after being used for a while with a predictable rate of increase. These issues were solved for Pixels and should have trickled down to other Android devices now, although we haven&#x27;t looked at how it currently works elsewhere. One relatively minor non-scanning issue is known and they should be working on it and fixing it in a few months. [...] &#x27;&gt; I saw you recommended turning the phone off, that also doesn&#x27;t prevent tracking. Powered off in a faraday bag, maybe.&#x27; Airplane mode and turning off the device work fine in practice if it doesn&#x27;t have a special offline tracking system such as Apple&#x27;s optional Find My network. Regulations essentially require both of those to work properly but are poorly enforced. Devices can make mistakes and have issues like airplane mode not being active in early boot. It&#x27;s unlikely for it to be improperly implemented on something like an iPhone though.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1846709900715458703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1846709900715458703<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-98" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-98">98</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, October 17. <em>&quot;Changing the IMEI does not work in the same way as MAC randomization with a modern Wi-Fi radio supporting private usage by avoiding other identifiers.

We strongly recommend it as a replacement for a work profile managed by a local profile admin app. It has better OS integration and isolation. Private Space is an isolated workspace (profile) for apps and data similar to both user profiles and work profiles. All 3 forms of profiles also have entirely separate VPN configuration which is very useful even if you connected to the same VPN, since exit IPs can be separate. All forms of profiles have separate encryption keys. You can keep a Private Space at rest while the Owner user is logged in just as you can with a secondary user. Private Space makes it easier to share data than users. The clipboard is shared, but we could add a setting for it. GrapheneOS users choose to use the OS in different ways. A lot of people largely use open source apps and not sandboxed Google Play. Others use sandboxed Google Play in their main profile. Many use sandboxed Google Play in a dedicated profile to choose which apps use it. Regardless of how people choose to use sandboxed Google Play, they&#x27;re regular sandboxed apps without special access. Private Space makes it easier to use a dedicated profile for sandboxed Google Play though. It&#x27;s also worth noting you can still use a work profile alongside it. All of our features including Contact Scopes, Storage Scopes and sandboxed Google Play have full support for Private Space.

Installed packages are shared across all kinds of profiles. App data is entirely profile specific. Whether or not an app is installed is profile specific. For a given app id such as app.organicmaps, the packages are shared across each profile with them installed. The packages are removed once every profile fully uninstalls the app. The OS enforces that packages must have a matching signing key and equal or greater versionCode. Changes to signing keys must be authorized with key rotation proofs. They implemented it as sharing the installed packages to save storage, memory (smaller page cache) and bandwidth. It&#x27;s just something to bear in mind. The main way this comes up is because not all app developers follow best practices. You&#x27;re supposed to have a unique app id for each variant of app, including different types of builds or builds signed with different keys. Some devs reuse ids. F-Droid is the main offender. They reuse the app ids used by developers for their standalone and/or Play Store releases for nearly every single app in F-Droid despite nearly all being signed with F-Droid keys. This causes conflicts across profiles, which is confusing to users. F-Droid also causes usability issues with this another way.

There was not generally proper IOMMU isolation for other components not included in the SoC. Qualcomm handled it well, but Android OEMs and other hardware vendors didn&#x27;t. Since then, Android phone security has massively improved and proper isolation for most hardware components is the norm now. Laptop and desktop firmware/hardware security hasn&#x27;t improved much and is increasingly far behind, but IOMMU isolation is slowly getting fixed there.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1846372770692976760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1846372770692976760<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-136" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-136">136</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, October 15. <em>&quot;Google Pay unfortunately bans using any OS not certified by Google including a modified stock OS for NFC payments.

It lacks the basic building blocks for privacy and security. It has a horrible set of component choices for security, doesn&#x27;t get basic firmware updates and is missing very basic security features. It&#x27;s the opposite of a secure device. You were also hardly endorsing Purism there but rather talking about it as someone interested in the topic. Purism has been heavily promoting their products with highly misleading and outright false claims for many years, and it&#x27;s understandable people get misled by marketing. We have no interest at all in working with Purism or supporting their hardware. We&#x27;re very interested in working with an OEM to make hardware to run GrapheneOS but there&#x27;s absolutely no chance we work with them. They&#x27;re anti-security and the false marketing causes serious harm. Yes, and they don&#x27;t ship important firmware and microcode updates because of it. They also go out of the way to sabotage it by preventing updating important parts of the firmware from the OS, which instead has to be manually flashed with JTAG cables, etc. as if users will do it. They say update the firmware on their devices before shipping them, but then they don&#x27;t get updates anymore. They essentially acknowledge that it&#x27;s critical to security but then go out of the way to avoid it. This is the purpose and design of their products, not a side thing. Nearly the entire purpose of Purism products is avoiding updating the proprietary firmware from the OS. When they describe their hardware as open and freedom respecting, what they actually mean is the nearly entirely proprietary hardware/firmware works without the OS updating it. They make component choices largely based on using components which store firmware on their own flash storage and don&#x27;t require the OS to load it. This is generally a bad security practice and it&#x27;s no surprise that it leads to them choosing much less secure, sketchy components. [...] They not only avoid updating firmware/microcode, choose insecure components where they don&#x27;t have to load it from the OS and block updating it but they even remove warnings in the Linux kernel and other software about out-of-date firmware and information on how to update it. Yes, that&#x27;s what it does. The microcode/firmware is nearly entirely in the separate linux-firmware project. The vast majority of what they&#x27;re doing is stripping out portions of the ability to update firmware/microcode and removing warnings about it. See <a href="https://phoronix.com/news/GNU-Linux-Libre-4.16-Released" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://phoronix.com/news/GNU-Linux-Libre-4.16-Released<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. This is also largely what the distributions based on the same ideology are doing. They don&#x27;t only have an issue with shipping non-open-source software and in practice their main issue is actually with updating firmware/microcode that&#x27;s going to be present regardless. They don&#x27;t only have an issue with shipping the updates for it but even enabling people to obtain them and informing them about their device being insecure. They&#x27;re actively covering up vulnerabilities to the point they&#x27;re scrubbing it from log messages most people won&#x27;t see. [...] They remove these kinds of warnings because they view it as promoting updating the firmware which is what they&#x27;re against and the entire purpose of the project. They actively cover up security vulnerabilities and actively mislead people about it. It&#x27;s ideological, that&#x27;s all. They follow a religion based around software licensing, which tells them that closed source hardware and closed source firmware are out of scope as long as the firmware can&#x27;t be updated. To them, a Wi-Fi SoC with no onboard firmware is bad. One with hard-wired firmware is good. They prefer hardware with the ability to update the firmware somehow disabled or broken, which they consider to be making it freedom respecting since the ability to update the closed source firmware is gone so they consider it to be hardware and out of scope for free software. It&#x27;s standard FSF ideology. They could have taken the more logical approach considering open source hardware, firmware and software all important instead of only software. Instead, they came up with contrived justifications for why closed software is crucial but those aren&#x27;t. Purism is catering to this ideology as their market niche. They attract true believers in it to work there too. They view this as a crucial ideological battle and therefore as with many political activists are fine with things like blatantly lying in order to advance their goals.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1846323143285076435" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1846323143285076435<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-141" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-141">141</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, October 15. <em>&quot;We want to have our own hardware but we care deeply about providing an actually high level of privacy and security.

Fairphone 5 was in many ways a regression, and they used an SoC with CPU cores from 2021 without current security features to save money on support. Fairphone doesn&#x27;t really provide the kind of long term support they portray the devices as having. They portray shipping an update from 2022 in 2024 as 2 extra years of support compared to a device shipping it in 2022. That doesn&#x27;t really make any sense and should be corrected. As with other non-Pixel Android OEMs, they do not ship the monthly and quarterly updates. They ship the yearly ones around a year or more late for new devices, which gets longer through the device&#x27;s lifetime. The security backports are at least 1 month late, sometimes longer. They&#x27;re missing the firmware and driver updates we need for GrapheneOS, proper support for the latest OS version (which is now Android 15) and a bunch of the security features.

Even with a way to block the cameras, microphones and other sensors from working, it&#x27;s quite a disaster for a user&#x27;s main personal device to get compromised. An attacker can still get all their data including photos, videos, documents, all the app login sessions, keys, etc. Even a properly designed kill switch for the cameras or overall audio recording can&#x27;t offer any value while the user is actually using it. It makes sense to have a way of defending against a compromised device as a last resort, but a lot has already gone wrong at that point.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1843911741857771619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1843911741857771619<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-162" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-162">162</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, October 8. <em>&quot;[...] The most decentralized approach is each app using JobScheduler to schedule self-updates.

Qualcomm&#x27;s approach isn&#x27;t inherently less secure though. Any device with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth has a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth baseband. It&#x27;s often a unified chip because they&#x27;re very similar protocols and need a similar baseband chip / RTOS so it might as well be reused. Decent ones will have internal hardening included sandboxed processes. Bluetooth accessories have one too, not only devices supporting using them. Bluetooth accessories are usually quite bad at protecting against attacks and tend to be way behind on adopting current generation Bluetooth privacy/security or simply getting firmware patches. What&#x27;s the logic for being very concerned about a cellular radio but not a Wi-Fi radio? They&#x27;re isolated in the same way, or in the case of laptops/desktops often not really isolated at all right now. In many cases it&#x27;s even same company making both and the same baseband/RTOS. Since there are 3 separate chips for cellular, Wi-Fi/BT and GNSS on the phones we support, it&#x27;s technically possible to remove cellular and the phone will still function without it since they&#x27;re built to be robust to partial hardware failures. Samsung builds both the main SoC and the cellular radio, so what would you gain by removing the cellular radio instead of using airplane mode?

We recommend getting apps from the Accrescent app store for the ones already available. Using Obtainium to get apps directly from developers is far from perfect but is less bad than trusting F-Droid as a third party building/signing. Aurora Store isn&#x27;t a very secure way to get apps from the Play Store. For that purpose, we recommend the sandboxed Play Store feature supported by GrapheneOS for most use cases. APKs from the Play Store are mostly generated/signed by the Play Store and many contain Google Play. Since many of those apps contain Google Play SDK / libraries anyway, you&#x27;re running Google Play code in the app sandbox by using apps from there anyway. Some of the Google Play libraries don&#x27;t work without Play services but many including Ads and Analytics work without it. F-Droid can be used as a stopgap if you prefer it over getting apps from developers directly, but we strongly recommend considering migrating away from F-Droid in the long term. Aurora Store is an option, but has problems and isn&#x27;t usually what we recommend for most people. [...] No, every APK has a whole file signature using a much more modern approach than PGP. Android&#x27;s package manager verifies the signature of every installed APK. It enforces future updates being signed with the same key or a key authorized by it and disallows a lower versionCode. It&#x27;s possible to verify key fingerprint to confirm it matches the official developer signing keys. AppVerifier supports doing this automatically for the database of key fingerprints it has included in the app. It also supports manually checking with a provided key fingerprint. F-Droid obtains the source code to build and sign the apps from where it&#x27;s published on GitHub or elsewhere. If that&#x27;s compromised, they&#x27;ll build and sign compromised code. They don&#x27;t do even cursory review and even if they did would not be a viable way to find hidden attacks. F-Droid signs nearly all the apps themselves, meaning they&#x27;re another trusted party. You trust the developer, the platform where they downloaded the sources and F-Droid themselves compared to trusting the developer&#x27;s own signed releases. Accrescent is better than that though. Accrescent publishes the developer signed releases but it has signed metadata itself so it secures the initial download/install without users having to use AppVerifier to check the key fingerprint themselves. You can still do that after installing if you want though. F-Droid greatly increases the risk of a supply chain attack. They do not review/audit the code they&#x27;re packaging. They run trivial automated scans which attackers are aware of and can run themselves. It is highly unlikely to detect anything regardless. It&#x27;s more attack surface. F-Droid adds the F-Droid developers along with their poorly maintained infrastructure and build environment as attack surface for all the apps you install from it. Getting one app from it is definitely not as risky as getting as much as you can from it since apps are sandboxed. F-Droid doesn&#x27;t uphold basic security features and the security model for app sources. It doesn&#x27;t keep up with current era security protections. They allow infrastructure and the build environment to get incredibly out-of-date. Their core developers have anti-security attitudes.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1831053343520952611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1831053343520952611<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-191" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-191">191</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, September 9. <em>&quot;For privacy and security, a late model Google Pixel phone running GrapheneOS is the best option available.

GrapheneOS is based on the Android Open Source Project, not the stock Pixel OS. It doesn&#x27;t include Google apps or services. Hardware acceleration for AI is available on essentially every mobile device and isn&#x27;t something unique to Pixel devices. Pixels have best in class support for it, but it&#x27;s hardly used by GrapheneOS. Hardware accelerated processing for images is used is the same way as the stock OS for merging multiple frames together when capturing photos. Night mode uses the same approach but brightens the photo. The image processing mostly isn&#x27;t what people would refer to as AI since it mostly uses algorithms written by humans with parameters tuned by machine learning. There are parts which use neural nets including preview and video capture combining frames in a way that mimics HDR+. Hardware acceleration for generic AI software is available on GrapheneOS. Non-Google apps can use it via the standard AOSP APIs which weren&#x27;t very capable but are being overhauled to provide LLM model acceleration instead of a lower level, hard to use neural net acceleration API. Certain Google apps know how to directly use the TPU on Pixels acceleration for local AI hardware acceleration, so Pixels have more of these features than elsewhere. Pixel Camera and Google Photos are the major examples, but other Google apps use it. It&#x27;s a toggle on GrapheneOS. Since it doesn&#x27;t have any direct privacy impact due to not giving any additional access to data, our toggle for Google apps using the TPU is enabled by default. It exists in case someone wants to reduce attack surface. In theory, there could be a GPU acceleration toggle too.

(By code I&#x27;m referring to Dalvik bytecode, but there&#x27;s no need to get too technical.) AOSP makes the distinction between cold/hot code (&quot;hot&quot; = often used compared to &quot;cold&quot;) and uses AOT/JIT depending on the situation, whereas GrapheneOS chooses to use ART AOT all the way. This results in better security and performance, even battery life when you&#x27;re running apps. The inconvenience is that app installs can take longer, especially on a lower-end device.

Our GmsCompat app runs a foreground service and used to keep a connection open to Play services and Play Store. It now creates the connection on-demand when they need a foreground service. Toggling off background data usage for Play services and Play Store will now stop their background services being able to use data. That now blocks it from using mobile data when it&#x27;s not running a foreground service since another foreground service isn&#x27;t always using it anymore. Some users previously blocked background data usage for them and now they don&#x27;t have FCM and other features working anymore. Similarly, some users never granted it Unrestricted battery usage which was required for FCM to work reliably but is now even more required than before. Apps can be set to one of 3 different battery modes: Restricted, Optimized (Default) and Unrestricted. Optimized heavily restricts the app running in the background based on how much it&#x27;s used. Restricted nearly fully prevents apps running in the background on their own. Android 14 QPR2 changed this from a menu with the 3 options to a toggle for Restricted being on or off. The text next to the toggle is a button to open an inner menu with Optimized vs. Unrestricted. Users find this confusing and we&#x27;re considering changing it back to how it was. Our sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer makes a notification requesting Unrestricted battery usage for Play services with a permission request dialog. The issue is that if users miss this or dismiss it, it&#x27;s trickier than before to find the setting to enable it manually. We also show this as a detected issue in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Sandboxed Google Play in the suggestions in shows. The issue is that some users may want the background usage heavily restricted for sandboxed Play services. We don&#x27;t want to nag people who actually want it very limited. Our compatibility layer already shows a notification about this until users either grant Unrestricted battery mode for sandboxed Play services or press &quot;Don&#x27;t show again&quot; to dismiss the notification permanently. It will show again if it&#x27;s only dismissed without pressing that. It seems this isn&#x27;t quite enough because we see a steady stream of people not granting Unrestricted battery mode and not realizing it&#x27;s why their push notifications are delayed. It&#x27;s valid to not grant it to it. It runs fine without it granted but it means push, etc. won&#x27;t work. [...] Allow background usage toggle is not the same thing as the Unrestricted but rather Unrestricted is in the inner menu.

They should not be considered as a proper separate workspace, which user profiles are. Each user profile has its own encryption keys, making them more powerful if you want to strictly isolate data that apps should never access to. And as you said, you don&#x27;t need a third-party app to enable and manage the feature. [...] By their very nature, user profiles provide totally different workspaces and GrapheneOS provides the option to put the entire profile at rest with an &quot;End session&quot; button. Encryption keys are protected by their lock method like you would expect. You don&#x27;t get that flexibility with work profiles. In fact, each user profile has its own Weaver slot on the secure element. [...] GrapheneOS aims to make user profiles more convenient and the de facto choice for compartmentalization. By design, work profiles are also made to allow communication between apps on the user profile and the nested work profile. That can&#x27;t happen with apps on different user profiles (even the with the mutually consented IPC that takes place in a user profile) unless they use network (which can be revoked by the network permission, including localhost). (Also to be clear, the app sandbox always applies whether you use work/user profiles or not. These profiles are not substitutes for the app sandbox.) [...] the device manager app has ownership over the data of the work profile it manages, and not yourself, fundamentally.

You can&#x27;t trivially send IPSec through another VPN. Linux kernel doesn&#x27;t support nesting IPSec itself and it causes MTU issues when doing it multiple machines / virtual machines. Connectivity checks are optional and inherently need to check the underlying networks. NTP is UDP and correct time is required for certificate verification including for a VPN so Android has it bypass the VPN, but we don&#x27;t use NTP and we don&#x27;t have our HTTPS network time bypass the VPN. There are also the DNS requests to the DNS resolver provided by the network in order to do these things and to connect to the VPN server that&#x27;s being used. None of this is a leak but rather just how things are designed to work.

If you want to choose which apps use Google Play rather than making it available to all of them, install it in a separate user or work profile for apps depending on Google Play. You could also do it the other way around, but it makes more sense to try to use as much as possible without Google Play rather than treating not using it as the exceptional case. [...] Signing in into a Google account is optional, unless you want to use features depending on being signed into an account. For example, some apps use Google account authentication instead of their accounts having a username and password. The Play Store requires being signed into an account in order to install apps or use in-app purchases. [...] The Play Store provides many services used by apps including Play Asset Delivery, Play Feature Delivery, in-app purchases and license checks for paid apps. The Play Store app is also the most secure way to install and update apps from the Play Store. Our compatibility layer has support for Play Games Services which you can obtain by installing Google Play Games from the Play Store. Many games on the Play Store depend on having Google Play Games installed. [...] The compatibility layer has a configuration menu available at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Sandboxed Google Play. By default, apps using Google Play geolocation are redirected to our own implementation on top of the standard OS geolocation service. You don&#x27;t need to grant any permissions to Google Play or change any settings for working location in apps using Google Play geolocation due to our rerouting feature. If you want to use Google&#x27;s network location service to provide location estimates without satellite reception, you can disable the &quot;Reroute location requests to OS APIs&quot; toggle and grant what it requires to provide network location. You will need to grant &quot;Allow all the time&quot; Location access to Google Play services along with the Nearby Devices permission for it to have all the access it needs. You need to use the &quot;Google Location Accuracy&quot; link from the sandboxed Google Play configuration menu to access the Google Play services menu for opting into their network location service, otherwise this is all pointless. It will send the nearby Wi-Fi and cellular networks provided via the Location and Nearby Devices permissions to their service to retrieve a location estimate. In order to fully take advantage of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, you also need to enable the scanning toggles in Settings &gt; Location  &gt; Location services which are disabled by default and control whether apps with the required permissions can scan when Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are otherwise disabled. Re-routing location to the OS geolocation service will use more power than using the Google Play geolocation service since we do not provide a network-based location service and implement it via GNSS / A-GPS only. In the future, we plan on providing a pseudo-network geolocation service for the OS by using a local database of cell towers, and the location redirection feature can also make use of this future OS implementation for network location requests once it&#x27;s available.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://grapheneos.org/usage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://grapheneos.org/usage<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-277" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-277">277</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS Website, Usage guide, 2024, November 28. <em>&quot;eSIM: [...] in order to manage and add eSIMs, proprietary Google functionality is needed.

User profiles each have their own unique, randomly generated disk encryption key and their own unique key encryption key is used to encrypt it. The owner profile is special and is used to store sensitive system-wide operating system data. This is why the owner profile needs to be logged in after a reboot before other user profiles can be used. The owner profile does not have access to the data in other profiles. [...] GrapheneOS enables support for ending secondary user profile sessions after logging into them. It adds an end session button to the lockscreen and in the global action menu accessed by holding the power button. This fully purges the encryption keys and puts the profiles back at rest. This can&#x27;t be done for the owner profile without rebooting due to it encrypting the sensitive system-wide operating system data. Using a secondary profile for regular usage allows you to make use of the device without decrypting the data in your regular usage profile. It also allows putting it at rest without rebooting the device. Even if you use the same passphrase for multiple profiles, each of those profiles still ends up with a unique key encryption key and a compromise of the OS while one of them is active won&#x27;t leak the passphrase. The advantage to using separate passphrases is in case an attacker records you entering it. [...] In order to retrieve the Weaver token, the secure element requires the correct Weaver key. A secure internal timer is used to implement hardware-based delays for each attempt at key derivation. It quickly ramps up to 1 day delays before the next attempt.

[...] Cellular networks use inherently insecure protocols and have many trusted parties. Even if interception of the connection or some other man-in-the-middle attack along the network is not currently occurring, the network is still untrustworthy and information should not be sent unencrypted. Authenticated transport encryption such as HTTPS for web sites avoids trusting the cellular network. End-to-end encrypted protocols such as the Signal messaging protocol also avoid trusting the servers. [...] Connecting to your carrier&#x27;s network inherently depends on you identifying yourself to it and anyone able to obtain administrative access. Activating airplane mode will fully disable the cellular radio transmit and receive capabilities, which will prevent your phone from being reached from the cellular network and stop your carrier (and anyone impersonating them to you) from tracking the device via the cellular radio. The baseband implements other functionality such as Wi-Fi and GPS functionality, but each of these components is separately sandboxed on the baseband and independent of each other. Enabling airplane mode disables the cellular radio, but Wi-Fi can be re-enabled and used without activating the cellular radio again. This allows using the device as a Wi-Fi only device. Receiving a silent SMS is not a good indicator of being targeted by your cell carrier, police or government because anyone on the cell network can send them including yourself. Cellular triangulation will happen regardless of whether or not SMS texts are being sent or received by the phone. Even if an SMS did serve a useful purpose for tracking, a silent SMS would be little different than receiving unsolicited spam. In fact, sending spam would be stealthier since it wouldn&#x27;t trigger alerts for silent SMS but rather would be ignored with the rest of the spam. Regardless, sending texts or other data is not required or particularly useful to track devices connected to a network for an adversary with the appropriate access. Airplane mode is the only way to avoid the cellular network tracking your device and works correctly on the devices we support.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://grapheneos.org/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://grapheneos.org/faq<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-284" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-284">284</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS Website, Frequently Asked Questions, 2024, November 28. <em>&quot;When you have both a cellular connection and Location enabled, control plane and/or user plane (SUPL) A-GNSS is used in addition to PSDS to greatly reduce the time needed for GNSS to obtain an initial location lock.

By default, an Android app can only access a limited range of system resources. The system manages Android app access to resources that, if used incorrectly or maliciously, could adversely impact the user experience, the network, or data on the device. These restrictions are implemented in a variety of different forms. Some capabilities are restricted by an intentional lack of APIs to the sensitive functionality (for example, there is no Android API for directly manipulating the SIM card). In some instances, separation of roles provides a security measure, as with the per-app isolation of storage. In other instances, the sensitive APIs are intended for use by trusted apps and protected through a security mechanism known as Permissions.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/overview/app-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://source.android.com/docs/security/overview/app-security<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-302" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-302">302</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">Privacy Guides Forum Discussion, 2024, December 3. &quot;Sharing files between GrapheneOS profiles&quot;, <a href="https://discuss.privacyguides.net/t/sharing-files-between-grapheneos-profiles/13293/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://discuss.privacyguides.net/t/sharing-files-between-grapheneos-profiles/13293/1<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-303" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-303">303</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">@<a class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]" href="mailto:GrapheneOS@grapheneos.social">GrapheneOS@grapheneos.social</a>, 2024, July 20. <em>&quot;GrapheneOS App Store now includes a mirror of Accrescent, which is a privacy and security focused alternative to the Play Store distributing developer builds of apps: <a href="https://accrescent.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://accrescent.app/<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> Accrescent comes from within the GrapheneOS community and we&#x27;re collaborating together. Accrescent is in alpha and isn&#x27;t yet open to any developers uploading their apps. It will have a lot more apps available in the future. It will become a full alternative to Play Store permitting closed source apps too, but you&#x27;ll be able to filter to show only open source apps. Lead dev of Accrescent is a GrapheneOS user and contributor. It&#x27;ll be a good place to publish apps for GrapheneOS users. AppVerifier, BeauTyXT and Transcribro are from the same person who wrote our Info app. Molly is a security-focused fork of Signal from another GrapheneOS user. AppVerifier was based on a planned GrapheneOS feature for users to verify APK files based on their key fingerprint. The feature is currently stalled since relying on the clipboard isn&#x27;t ideal. For now, users can use AppVerifier from Accrescent until we ship a built-in approach. We&#x27;ll be delegating distributing developer builds of apps signed by the developers to Accrescent rather than doing it in ourselves. Our App Store will be focused on our own apps and eventually hardened, rebranded builds of important third party apps widely used by our community. [...] We can&#x27;t recommend using F-Droid due to extremely poor security practices throughout their client, repository design and infrastructure. The developers have an anti-security attitude and have demonstrated thoroughly untrustworthy behavior. We&#x27;re going to be supporting Accrescent and helping them get what they need to reach a stable release and provide a huge number of apps with the support of the app developers. People are free to use F-Droid on GrapheneOS but we won&#x27;t promote it. [...] F-Droid attempts to do repository metadata signing but both the approach they take and implementation is quite flawed. Transport security via HTTPS using WebPKI doesn&#x27;t only trust their server. It also trusts every CA and sub-CA without a way to monitor abuse since unlike a browser there isn&#x27;t enforced Certificate Transparency. We pin root keys and backup keys for our services in our apps but of course it&#x27;s not what&#x27;s relied on for verifying App Store repository metadata. [...] It does protect against an attacker who has compromised both the server for the app store and has obtained the developer&#x27;s signing key. They would need to put a backdoor into a release, which they could do whether or not it&#x27;s open source software and whether or not it&#x27;s built by the app store. F-Droid pretends building apps offers protection against this but the reality is that they blindly build the code and there is no way to auto-detect backdoors being added. [...] The app&#x27;s signing key is how the OS package manager verifies the app, but both our App Store and Accrescent also verify each downloaded APK based on the repository metadata. We were explaining that having control of the app repository and the developer&#x27;s signing key isn&#x27;t enough because the repository metadata is signed offline. That&#x27;s why we said they&#x27;d need to actually put a backdoor into either the app&#x27;s source code or the latest official build of the app. Reproducible build verification can&#x27;t actually prevent this. It only prevents them putting it into the build without also putting it into the source code. It&#x27;s clearly possible to put a backdoor into the source code without it being detected as shown by the multiple times it has been caught happening after the fact in widely used projects. The most well known recent example was the xz ssh backdoor, but that&#x27;s not the only one, and there may be important missed cases.&quot;</em>, <a href="https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/112821386750410102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]">https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/112821386750410102<span class="nx-sr-only nx-select-none"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></p></td></tr><tr id="reference-304" class="border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-neutral-700/50"><td class="whitespace-pre py-2 font-mono text-xs font-semibold leading-6 text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-500">[<a href="#reference-304">304</a>]</td><td class="py-2 pl-6"><p class="nx-mt-6 nx-leading-7 first:nx-mt-0">GrapheneOS (@GrapheneOS), 2024, December 29. <em>&quot;Our 2-factor fingerprint unlock feature is now fully implemented and will be available in the upcoming GrapheneOS release. This adds the option to set a PIN for using fingerprint unlock. You can use a strong diceware passphrase as the primary unlock method with fingerprint+PIN secondary unlock. The usual restrictions on fingerprint unlock still apply. It&#x27;s a secondary unlock mechanism only usable for 48 hours after the last primary unlock. The limit on failed fingerprint unlock attempts in GrapheneOS is 5 as opposed to allowing 4 batches of 5 attempts (20 total) with 30s delays in between. The devices we support have a high quality secure element heavily throttling unlock attempts which is why a random 6 digit PIN provides secure encryption, unlike most Android devices. It&#x27;s nicer to have a strong passphrase not depending on an attacker never being able to exploit the secure element. Our new 2-factor fingerprint unlock feature means you can get this benefit of a strong passphrase while still having the convenience of a PIN. Since our PIN scrambling feature works with the 2nd factor PIN, you get the combined anti-shoulder-surfing benefits of a scrambled PIN and a fingerprint. If you want to avoid entering your passphrase in public, you just need to make sure to refresh the 48 hour timer after last using it to unlock to keep fingerprint unlock available. We plan to add configuration for how many failed fingerprint unlock attempts are allowed to help with this use case. We came up with the concept for this 2-factor fingerprint unlock feature in 2015 and filed it in the public issue tracker in 2016. This was extremely difficult to implement correctly and we needed to fix multiple upstream Android bugs. The lockscreen will be more robust even if you don&#x27;t use this. This is now one of the flagship features of GrapheneOS alongside hardened_malloc, hardware memory tagging, hardware-level disabling of the USB-C port, Storage Scopes, Contact Scopes, sandboxed Google Play compatibility layer, etc. It will be harder to port to new versions than our existing features. Our duress PIN/password feature is fully compatible with our 2-factor fingerprint unlock and will near instantly wipe the device as usual if you enter the duress PIN instead of the correct 2nd factor PIN for fingerprint unlock.
